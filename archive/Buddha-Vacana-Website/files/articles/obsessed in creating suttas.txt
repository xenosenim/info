what obsessed people with the suttas

KN and abh considered more worthy of being learnt (sn20.7)

joutes verbales with brahmins
despising brahmins

connection with lay people, specially receiving requisites, and being worthy of it

stories about gods the origin of the universe, cakkavatthi etc.

creating pieces of teaching with abhidhamma certainly to justify the new teachings
and clearly, the suttas were alerady disregarded as something inferior, treated with contempt and this is probably where the manipulations started, because people lost the respect for buddha vacana
