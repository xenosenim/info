according to it, many others do not care to do it. </P>

<P>331. Bhikkhus, a few are shaken with religious emotion in a circumstance many 

others do not stir whatever the circumstance may be. </P>

<P>332. Bhikkhus, a few stirred by religious emotion, make effort to overcome 

unpleasantness, there are many others who do nothing about it. </P>

<P>333. Bhikkhus, a few change their object of concentration and gain one point 

of mind. There are others who do not reach one point of mind when they change 

the object of concentration. </P>

<P>334. In the same way bhikkhus, a few are fed on the most excellent food and 

the rest feed on whatever available crumbs. </P>

<P>335. Bhikkhus, a few find access to the meanings of the Teaching and the bliss 

of release, others do not experience release. Therefore bhikkhus, you should 

train to see the meanings in the Teaching to experience the bliss of release.
