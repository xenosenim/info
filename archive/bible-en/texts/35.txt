### <a name='g1'></a>Chapter 1
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <i>even</i> cry out unto thee <i>of</i> violence, and thou wilt not save!</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <i>me</i> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence <i>are</i> before me: and there are <i>that</i> raise up strife and contention.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <i>I</i> will work a work in your days, <i>which</i> ye will not believe, though it be told <i>you</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <i>that</i> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces <i>that are</i> not theirs.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; They <i>are</i> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle <i>that</i> hasteth to eat.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up <i>as</i> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; Then shall <i>his</i> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <i>imputing</i> this his power unto his god.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; <i>Art</i> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; <i>Thou art</i> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <i>and</i> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <i>the man that is</i> more righteous than he?</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <i>that have</i> no ruler over them?</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <i>is</i> fat, and their meat plenteous.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</p>

### <a name='g2'></a>Chapter 2
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it</i> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; For the vision <i>is</i> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; Behold, his soul <i>which</i> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, <i>he is</i> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and <i>is</i> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth <i>that which is</i> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and <i>for</i> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned <i>against</i> thy soul.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Behold, <i>is it</i> not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <i>him</i>, and makest <i>him</i> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing <i>shall be</i> on thy glory.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <i>which</i> made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it <i>is</i> laid over with gold and silver, and <i>there is</i> no breath at all in the midst of it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; But the LORD <i>is</i> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</p>

### <a name='g3'></a>Chapter 3
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <i>and</i> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; And <i>his</i> brightness was as the light; he had horns <i>coming</i> out of his hand: and there <i>was</i> the hiding of his power.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <i>are</i> everlasting.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <i>and</i> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? <i>was</i> thine anger against the rivers? <i>was</i> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <i>and</i> thy chariots of salvation?</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Thy bow was made quite naked, <i>according</i> to the oaths of the tribes, <i>even thy</i> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; The mountains saw thee, <i>and</i> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <i>and</i> lifted up his hands on high.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; The sun <i>and</i> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <i>and</i> at the shining of thy glittering spear.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <i>even</i> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <i>was</i> as to devour the poor secretly.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <i>through</i> the heap of great waters.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <i>shall</i> fruit <i>be</i> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <i>there shall be</i> no herd in the stalls:</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; The LORD God <i>is</i> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' <i>feet</i>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</p>
