# Outs

### Outs

An out is any card that can improve a player’s hand.
For example, if a player has four cards to a flush, there are nine remaining cards of that suit in the deck.
Therefore, the player has nine outs to complete their flush.

Выражается в виде десятичной дроби 0.0 - 1.0
0 - событие никогда не произойдет

### Odds /шансы/
[!
Во сколько раз более вероятно, что событие произойдет, чем не произойдет?
Oтношение шансов наступления события к шансам его ненаступления

relationship between number of favorable outcomes in a given situation versus the number of unfavorable outcomes.


Calculating Odds from Probability

If you have a ratio describing probability, i.e. 33% or 1:2, calculate the odds by dividing the outcome you want over all possible outcomes (1/(1+2) = 1/3), then use the formula Odds = P / (1 - P), in this example O = .33 / (1 - .33) = .5.


 Determine the number of favorable outcomes in a situation
  Determine the number of unfavorable outcomes.


  Express odds numerically. Generally, odds are expressed as the ratio of favorable outcomes to unfavorable outcomes, often using a colon. In our example, our odds of success would be 2 : 4 - two chances that we'll win versus four chances that we'll lose. Like a fraction, this can be simplified to 1 : 2 by dividing both terms by the common multiple of 2. This ratio is written (in words) as "one to two odds."[4]

### Pot Odds

Pot odds refer to the ratio of the current size of the pot to the cost of a contemplated call

For example, if the pot is $100 and a player needs to call a $20 bet to continue playing, the pot odds are 5 to 1. If the odds of completing the hand are 4 to 1, it would be a profitable decision to call the bet. However, if the odds of completing the hand are 6 to 1, it would be a losing decision to call.
