<h3><a name='g1'></a>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; But his delight <i>is</i> in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; The ungodly <i>are</i> not so: but <i>are</i> like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>

<h3><a name='g2'></a>Chapter 2</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, <i>saying</i>,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou <i>art</i> my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Ask of me, and I shall give <i>thee</i> the heathen <i>for</i> thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth <i>for</i> thy possession.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; But thou, O LORD, <i>art</i> a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set <i>themselves</i> against me round about.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies <i>upon</i> the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me <i>when I was</i> in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; <i>There be</i> many that say, Who will shew us <i>any</i> good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p>

<h3><a name='g5'></a>Chapter 5</h3>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct <i>my prayer</i> unto thee, and will look up.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; For thou <i>art</i> not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; But as for me, I will come <i>into</i> thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: <i>and</i> in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; For <i>there is</i> no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part <i>is</i> very wickedness; their throat <i>is</i> an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>

<h3><a name='g6'></a>Chapter 6</h3>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I <i>am</i> weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; For in death <i>there is</i> no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.</p>

<h3><a name='g7'></a>Chapter 7</h3>

<p class='intro'>Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending <i>it</i> in pieces, while <i>there is</i> none to deliver.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take <i>it</i>; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me <i>to</i> the judgment <i>that</i> thou hast commanded.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity <i>that is</i> in me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; My defence <i>is</i> of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry <i>with the wicked</i> every day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch <i>which</i> he made.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</p>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; I will praise <i>thee</i>, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble <i>which I suffer</i> of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; The heathen are sunk down in the pit <i>that</i> they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The LORD is known <i>by</i> the judgment <i>which</i> he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; The wicked shall be turned into hell, <i>and</i> all the nations that forget God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall <i>not</i> perish for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? <i>why</i> hidest thou <i>thyself</i> in times of trouble?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; The wicked in <i>his</i> pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, <i>whom</i> the LORD abhorreth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek <i>after God</i>: God <i>is</i> not in all his thoughts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; His ways are always grievous; thy judgments <i>are</i> far above out of his sight: <i>as for</i> all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for <i>I shall</i> never <i>be</i> in adversity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue <i>is</i> mischief and vanity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; He croucheth, <i>and</i> humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Thou hast seen <i>it</i>; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite <i>it</i> with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil <i>man</i>: seek out his wickedness <i>till</i> thou find none.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: <i>this shall be</i> the portion of their cup.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited <i>me</i> in the night; thou hast tried me, <i>and</i> shalt find nothing; I am purposed <i>that</i> my mouth shall not transgress.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept <i>me from</i> the paths of the destroyer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Hold up my goings in thy paths, <i>that</i> my footsteps slip not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, <i>and hear</i> my speech.</p>

<h3><a name='g18'></a>Chapter 18</h3>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician, <i>A Psalm</i> of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <i>that</i> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, <i>and</i> my high tower.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; I will call upon the LORD, <i>who is worthy</i> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, <i>even</i> into his ears.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness <i>was</i> under his feet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him <i>were</i> dark waters <i>and</i> thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; At the brightness <i>that was</i> before him his thick clouds passed, hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail <i>stones</i> and coals of fire.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; For all his judgments <i>were</i> before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; <i>As for</i> God, his way <i>is</i> perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he <i>is</i> a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; For who <i>is</i> God save the LORD? or who <i>is</i> a rock save our God?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; He maketh my feet like hinds' <i>feet</i>, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span>&ensp; I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span>&ensp; I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>39</span>&ensp; For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>40</span>&ensp; Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>41</span>&ensp; They cried, but <i>there was</i> none to save <i>them: even</i> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>42</span>&ensp; Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>43</span>&ensp; Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; <i>and</i> thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people <i>whom</i> I have not known shall serve me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>44</span>&ensp; As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>45</span>&ensp; The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>46</span>&ensp; The LORD liveth; and blessed <i>be</i> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>47</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>48</span>&ensp; He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>49</span>&ensp; Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>50</span>&ensp; Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>

<h3><a name='g22'></a>Chapter 22</h3>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A Psalm of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <i>why art thou so</i> far from helping me, <i>and from</i> the words of my roaring?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; But thou <i>art</i> holy, <i>O thou</i> that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; But I <i>am</i> a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, <i>saying</i>,</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou <i>art</i> my God from my mother's belly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Be not far from me; for trouble <i>is</i> near; for <i>there is</i> none to help.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Many bulls have compassed me: strong <i>bulls</i> of Bashan have beset me round.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; They gaped upon me <i>with</i> their mouths, <i>as</i> a ravening and a roaring lion.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; I may tell all my bones: they look <i>and</i> stare upon me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: <i>for</i> praise is comely for the upright.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery <i>and</i> an instrument of ten strings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; For the word of the LORD <i>is</i> right; and all his works <i>are done</i> in truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; For he spake, and it was <i>done</i>; he commanded, and it stood fast.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the nation whose God <i>is</i> the LORD; <i>and</i> the people <i>whom</i> he hath chosen for his own inheritance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; An horse <i>is</i> a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver <i>any</i> by his great strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Behold, the eye of the LORD <i>is</i> upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he <i>is</i> our help and our shield.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.</p>

<p class='intro'><i>A Psalm</i> of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise <i>shall</i> continually <i>be</i> in my mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear <i>thereof</i>, and be glad.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; This poor man cried, and the LORD heard <i>him</i>, and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; The eyes of the LORD <i>are</i> upon the righteous, and his ears <i>are open</i> unto their cry.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The face of the LORD <i>is</i> against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; <i>The righteous</i> cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Many <i>are</i> the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</p>

<p class='intro'><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Draw out also the spear, and stop <i>the way</i> against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I <i>am</i> thy salvation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For without cause have they hid for me their net <i>in</i> a pit, <i>which</i> without cause they have digged for my soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge <i>things</i> that I knew not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; They rewarded me evil for good <i>to</i> the spoiling of my soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing <i>was</i> sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; I behaved myself as though <i>he had been</i> my friend <i>or</i> brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth <i>for his</i> mother.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; <i>This</i> thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, <i>even</i> unto my cause, my God and my Lord.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify <i>themselves</i> against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, <i>that there is</i> no fear of God before his eyes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Thy righteousness <i>is</i> like the great mountains; thy judgments <i>are</i> a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Trust in the LORD, and do good; <i>so</i> shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring <i>it</i> to pass.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; For yet a little while, and the wicked <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i>: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; A little that a righteous man hath <i>is</i> better than the riches of many wicked.</p>

<p class='intro'>A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; <i>There is</i> no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither <i>is there any</i> rest in my bones because of my sin.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; My wounds stink <i>and</i> are corrupt because of my foolishness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For my loins are filled with a loathsome <i>disease</i>: and <i>there is</i> no soundness in my flesh.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Lord, all my desire <i>is</i> before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; They also that seek after my life lay snares <i>for me</i>: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; But I, as a deaf <i>man</i>, heard not; and <i>I was</i> as a dumb man <i>that</i> openeth not his mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth <i>are</i> no reproofs.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; For I said, <i>Hear me</i>, lest <i>otherwise</i> they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify <i>themselves</i> against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; For I <i>am</i> ready to halt, and my sorrow <i>is</i> continually before me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; But mine enemies <i>are</i> lively, <i>and</i> they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow <i>the thing that</i> good <i>is</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Thou hast given us like sheep <i>appointed</i> for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase <i>thy wealth</i> by their price.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin <i>is</i> ever before me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done <i>this</i> evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, <i>and</i> be clear when thou judgest.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me <i>with thy</i> free spirit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; <i>Then</i> will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give <i>it</i>: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; The sacrifices of God <i>are</i> a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Who whet their tongue like a sword, <i>and</i> bend <i>their bows to shoot</i> their arrows, <i>even</i> bitter words:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; They encourage themselves <i>in</i> an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward <i>thought</i> of every one <i>of them</i>, and the heart, <i>is</i> deep.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; But God shall shoot at them <i>with</i> an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <i>my</i> soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; I sink in deep mire, where <i>there is</i> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, <i>being</i> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <i>that</i> which I took not away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; When I wept, <i>and chastened</i> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <i>was</i> the song of the drunkards.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; But as for me, my prayer <i>is</i> unto thee, O LORD, <i>in</i> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness <i>is</i> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Draw nigh unto my soul, <i>and</i> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries <i>are</i> all before thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked <i>for some</i> to take pity, but <i>there was</i> none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Let their table become a snare before them: and <i>that which should have been</i> for <i>their</i> welfare, <i>let it become</i> a trap.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Let their habitation be desolate; <i>and</i> let none dwell in their tents.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; For they persecute <i>him</i> whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; But I <i>am</i> poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; <i>This</i> also shall please the LORD better than an ox <i>or</i> bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; The humble shall see <i>this, and</i> be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>

<p class='intro'>A Psalm of Asaph.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Truly God <i>is</i> good to Israel, <i>even</i> to such as are of a clean heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; For I was envious at the foolish, <i>when</i> I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; For <i>there are</i> no bands in their death: but their strength <i>is</i> firm.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; They <i>are</i> not in trouble <i>as other</i> men; neither are they plagued like <i>other</i> men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them <i>as</i> a garment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; They are corrupt, and speak wickedly <i>concerning</i> oppression: they speak loftily.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full <i>cup</i> are wrung out to them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Behold, these <i>are</i> the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase <i>in</i> riches.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Verily I have cleansed my heart <i>in</i> vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend <i>against</i> the generation of thy children.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; When I thought to know this, it <i>was</i> too painful for me;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Until I went into the sanctuary of God; <i>then</i> understood I their end.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; How are they <i>brought</i> into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; As a dream when <i>one</i> awaketh; <i>so</i>, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; So foolish <i>was</i> I, and ignorant: I was <i>as</i> a beast before thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Nevertheless I <i>am</i> continually with thee: thou hast holden <i>me</i> by my right hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me <i>to</i> glory.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Whom have I in heaven <i>but thee</i>? and <i>there is</i> none upon earth <i>that</i> I desire beside thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; My flesh and my heart faileth: <i>but</i> God <i>is</i> the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; But <i>it is</i> good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</p>

<p class='intro'>Maschil of Asaph.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; O God, why hast thou cast <i>us</i> off for ever? <i>why</i> doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Remember thy congregation, <i>which</i> thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, <i>which</i> thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; <i>even</i> all <i>that</i> the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns <i>for</i> signs.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; <i>A man</i> was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled <i>by casting down</i> the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; We see not our signs: <i>there is</i> no more any prophet: neither <i>is there</i> among us any that knoweth how long.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck <i>it</i> out of thy bosom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; For God <i>is</i> my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, <i>and</i> gavest him <i>to be</i> meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The day <i>is</i> thine, the night also <i>is</i> thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Remember this, <i>that</i> the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and <i>that</i> the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude <i>of the wicked</i>: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</p>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; I cried unto God with my voice, <i>even</i> unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth <i>his</i> promise fail for evermore?</p>

<h3><a name='g78'></a>Chapter 78</h3>

<p class='intro'>Maschil of Asaph.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Give ear, O my people, <i>to</i> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; We will not hide <i>them</i> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; That the generation to come might know <i>them, even</i> the children <i>which</i> should be born; <i>who</i> should arise and declare <i>them</i> to their children:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <i>that</i> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; The children of Ephraim, <i>being</i> armed, <i>and</i> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <i>in</i> the field of Zoan.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <i>them</i> drink as <i>out of</i> the great depths.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Therefore the LORD heard <i>this</i>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; And he let <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <i>was</i> yet in their mouths,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <i>men</i> of Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; And they remembered that God <i>was</i> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span>&ensp; For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span>&ensp; But he, <i>being</i> full of compassion, forgave <i>their</i> iniquity, and destroyed <i>them</i> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>39</span>&ensp; For he remembered that they <i>were but</i> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>40</span>&ensp; How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <i>and</i> grieve him in the desert!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>41</span>&ensp; Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>42</span>&ensp; They remembered not his hand, <i>nor</i> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>43</span>&ensp; How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>44</span>&ensp; And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>45</span>&ensp; He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>46</span>&ensp; He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>47</span>&ensp; He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>48</span>&ensp; He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>49</span>&ensp; He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <i>among them</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>50</span>&ensp; He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>51</span>&ensp; And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <i>their</i> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>52</span>&ensp; But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>53</span>&ensp; And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>54</span>&ensp; And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <i>even to</i> this mountain, <i>which</i> his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>55</span>&ensp; He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>56</span>&ensp; Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>57</span>&ensp; But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>58</span>&ensp; For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>59</span>&ensp; When God heard <i>this</i>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>60</span>&ensp; So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <i>which</i> he placed among men;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>61</span>&ensp; And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>62</span>&ensp; He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>63</span>&ensp; The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>64</span>&ensp; Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>65</span>&ensp; Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <i>and</i> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>66</span>&ensp; And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>67</span>&ensp; Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>68</span>&ensp; But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>69</span>&ensp; And he built his sanctuary like high <i>palaces</i>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>70</span>&ensp; He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>71</span>&ensp; From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>72</span>&ensp; So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; The dead bodies of thy servants have they given <i>to be</i> meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and <i>there was</i> none to bury <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <i>is</i> their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight <i>by</i> the revenging of the blood of thy servants <i>which is</i> shed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</p>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician upon Shoshannimeduth, A Psalm of Asaph.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest <i>between</i> the cherubims, shine forth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come <i>and</i> save us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Thou preparedst <i>room</i> before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof <i>were like</i> the goodly cedars.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Why hast thou <i>then</i> broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch <i>that</i> thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> burned with fire, <i>it is</i> cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man <i>whom</i> thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician upon Gittith, <i>A Psalm</i> of Asaph.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; For this <i>was</i> a statute for Israel, <i>and</i> a law of the God of Jacob.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; This he ordained in Joseph <i>for</i> a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: <i>where</i> I heard a language <i>that</i> I understood not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: <i>and</i> they walked in their own counsels.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, <i>and</i> Israel had walked in my ways!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from <i>being</i> a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; That <i>men</i> may know that thou, whose name alone <i>is</i> JEHOVAH, <i>art</i> the most high over all the earth.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; For a thousand years in thy sight <i>are but</i> as yesterday when it is past, and <i>as</i> a watch in the night.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are <i>as</i> a sleep: in the morning <i>they are</i> like grass <i>which</i> groweth up.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret <i>sins</i> in the light of thy countenance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale <i>that is told</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; The days of our years <i>are</i> threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength <i>they be</i> fourscore years, yet <i>is</i> their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, <i>so is</i> thy wrath.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; So teach <i>us</i> to number our days, that we may apply <i>our</i> hearts unto wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Mine enemies reproach me all the day; <i>and</i> they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; My days <i>are</i> like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Thou shalt arise, <i>and</i> have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years <i>are</i> throughout all generations.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens <i>are</i> the work of thy hands.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; But thou <i>art</i> the same, and thy years shall have no end.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</p>

<h3><a name='g103'></a>Chapter 103</h3>

<p class='intro'><i>A Psalm</i> of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, <i>bless</i> his holy name.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Who satisfieth thy mouth with good <i>things; so that</i> thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; He will not always chide: neither will he keep <i>his anger</i> for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; For as the heaven is high above the earth, <i>so</i> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; As far as the east is from the west, <i>so</i> far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Like as a father pitieth <i>his</i> children, <i>so</i> the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we <i>are</i> dust.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; <i>As for</i> man, his days <i>are</i> as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; But the mercy of the LORD <i>is</i> from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Bless ye the LORD, all <i>ye</i> his hosts; <i>ye</i> ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</p>

<h3><a name='g104'></a>Chapter 104</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Who coverest <i>thyself</i> with light as <i>with</i> a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; <i>Who</i> laid the foundations of the earth, <i>that</i> it should not be removed for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Thou coveredst it with the deep as <i>with</i> a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; He sendeth the springs into the valleys, <i>which</i> run among the hills.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, <i>which</i> sing among the branches.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And wine <i>that</i> maketh glad the heart of man, <i>and</i> oil to make <i>his</i> face to shine, and bread <i>which</i> strengtheneth man's heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The trees of the LORD are full <i>of sap</i>; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Where the birds make their nests: <i>as for</i> the stork, the fir trees <i>are</i> her house.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; The high hills <i>are</i> a refuge for the wild goats; <i>and</i> the rocks for the conies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep <i>forth</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; <i>So is</i> this great and wide sea, wherein <i>are</i> things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; There go the ships: <i>there is</i> that leviathan, <i>whom</i> thou hast made to play therein.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give <i>them</i> their meat in due season.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; <i>That</i> thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.</p>

<h3><a name='g105'></a>Chapter 105</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; He <i>is</i> the LORD our God: his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word <i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Which <i>covenant</i> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, <i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; When they were <i>but</i> a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; When they went from one nation to another, from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; <i>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; He sent a man before them, <i>even</i> Joseph, <i>who</i> was sold for a servant:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; The king sent and loosed him; <i>even</i> the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; He sent Moses his servant; <i>and</i> Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, <i>and</i> lice in all their coasts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; He gave them hail for rain, <i>and</i> flaming fire in their land.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span>&ensp; He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and <i>there was</i> not one feeble <i>person</i> among their tribes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span>&ensp; Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>39</span>&ensp; He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>40</span>&ensp; <i>The people</i> asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>41</span>&ensp; He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places <i>like</i> a river.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>42</span>&ensp; For he remembered his holy promise, <i>and</i> Abraham his servant.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>43</span>&ensp; And he brought forth his people with joy, <i>and</i> his chosen with gladness:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>44</span>&ensp; And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>45</span>&ensp; That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? <i>who</i> can shew forth all his praise?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Blessed <i>are</i> they that keep judgment, <i>and</i> he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Remember me, O LORD, with the favour <i>that thou bearest unto</i> thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked <i>him</i> at the sea, <i>even</i> at the Red sea.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And he saved them from the hand of him that hated <i>them</i>, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; They envied Moses also in the camp, <i>and</i> Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <i>and</i> terrible things by the Red sea.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; But murmured in their tents, <i>and</i> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Thus they provoked <i>him</i> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and <i>so</i> the plague was stayed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; They angered <i>him</i> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span>&ensp; Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span>&ensp; And shed innocent blood, <i>even</i> the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>39</span>&ensp; Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>40</span>&ensp; Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>41</span>&ensp; And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>42</span>&ensp; Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>43</span>&ensp; Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked <i>him</i> with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>44</span>&ensp; Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>45</span>&ensp; And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>46</span>&ensp; He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>47</span>&ensp; Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, <i>and</i> to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>48</span>&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Let the redeemed of the LORD say <i>so</i>, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, <i>and</i> he saveth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered <i>them</i> from their destructions.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; Oh that <i>men</i> would praise the LORD <i>for</i> his goodness, and <i>for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span>&ensp; And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span>&ensp; He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>39</span>&ensp; Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>40</span>&ensp; He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, <i>where there is</i> no way.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>41</span>&ensp; Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh <i>him</i> families like a flock.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>42</span>&ensp; The righteous shall see <i>it</i>, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>43</span>&ensp; Whoso <i>is</i> wise, and will observe these <i>things</i>, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; For my love they are my adversaries: but I <i>give myself unto</i> prayer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Let his days be few; <i>and</i> let another take his office.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek <i>their bread</i> also out of their desolate places.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Let his posterity be cut off; <i>and</i> in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Let it be unto him as the garment <i>which</i> covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; <i>Let</i> this <i>be</i> the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy <i>is</i> good, deliver thou me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; For I <i>am</i> poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; I became also a reproach unto them: <i>when</i> they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; That they may know that this <i>is</i> thy hand; <i>that</i> thou, LORD, hast done it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save <i>him</i> from those that condemn his soul.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Thou hast commanded <i>us</i> to keep thy precepts diligently.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed <i>thereto</i> according to thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Blessed <i>art</i> thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as <i>much as</i> in all riches.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Deal bountifully with thy servant, <i>that</i> I may live, and keep thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; I <i>am</i> a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; My soul breaketh for the longing <i>that it hath</i> unto thy judgments at all times.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Thou hast rebuked the proud <i>that are</i> cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Princes also did sit <i>and</i> speak against me: <i>but</i> thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Thy testimonies also <i>are</i> my delight <i>and</i> my counsellors.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid <i>before me</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it <i>unto</i> the end.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with <i>my</i> whole heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span>&ensp; Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; <i>and</i> quicken thou me in thy way.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span>&ensp; Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who <i>is devoted</i> to thy fear.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>39</span>&ensp; Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments <i>are</i> good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>40</span>&ensp; Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>41</span>&ensp; Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, <i>even</i> thy salvation, according to thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>42</span>&ensp; So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>43</span>&ensp; And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>44</span>&ensp; So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>45</span>&ensp; And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>46</span>&ensp; I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>47</span>&ensp; And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>48</span>&ensp; My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>49</span>&ensp; Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>50</span>&ensp; This <i>is</i> my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>51</span>&ensp; The proud have had me greatly in derision: <i>yet</i> have I not declined from thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>52</span>&ensp; I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>53</span>&ensp; Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>54</span>&ensp; Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>55</span>&ensp; I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>56</span>&ensp; This I had, because I kept thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>57</span>&ensp; <i>Thou art</i> my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>58</span>&ensp; I intreated thy favour with <i>my</i> whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>59</span>&ensp; I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>60</span>&ensp; I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>61</span>&ensp; The bands of the wicked have robbed me: <i>but</i> I have not forgotten thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>62</span>&ensp; At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>63</span>&ensp; I <i>am</i> a companion of all <i>them</i> that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>64</span>&ensp; The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>65</span>&ensp; Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>66</span>&ensp; Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>67</span>&ensp; Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>68</span>&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>69</span>&ensp; The proud have forged a lie against me: <i>but</i> I will keep thy precepts with <i>my</i> whole heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>70</span>&ensp; Their heart is as fat as grease; <i>but</i> I delight in thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>71</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>72</span>&ensp; The law of thy mouth <i>is</i> better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>73</span>&ensp; Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>74</span>&ensp; They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>75</span>&ensp; I know, O LORD, that thy judgments <i>are</i> right, and <i>that</i> thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>76</span>&ensp; Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>77</span>&ensp; Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law <i>is</i> my delight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>78</span>&ensp; Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: <i>but</i> I will meditate in thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>79</span>&ensp; Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>80</span>&ensp; Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>81</span>&ensp; My soul fainteth for thy salvation: <i>but</i> I hope in thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>82</span>&ensp; Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>83</span>&ensp; For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; <i>yet</i> do I not forget thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>84</span>&ensp; How many <i>are</i> the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>85</span>&ensp; The proud have digged pits for me, which <i>are</i> not after thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>86</span>&ensp; All thy commandments <i>are</i> faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>87</span>&ensp; They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>88</span>&ensp; Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>89</span>&ensp; For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>90</span>&ensp; Thy faithfulness <i>is</i> unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>91</span>&ensp; They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all <i>are</i> thy servants.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>92</span>&ensp; Unless thy law <i>had been</i> my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>93</span>&ensp; I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>94</span>&ensp; I <i>am</i> thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>95</span>&ensp; The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: <i>but</i> I will consider thy testimonies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>96</span>&ensp; I have seen an end of all perfection: <i>but</i> thy commandment <i>is</i> exceeding broad.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>97</span>&ensp; O how love I thy law! it <i>is</i> my meditation all the day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>98</span>&ensp; Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they <i>are</i> ever with me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>99</span>&ensp; I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies <i>are</i> my meditation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>100</span>&ensp; I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>101</span>&ensp; I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>102</span>&ensp; I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>103</span>&ensp; How sweet are thy words unto my taste! <i>yea, sweeter</i> than honey to my mouth!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>104</span>&ensp; Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>105</span>&ensp; Thy word <i>is</i> a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>106</span>&ensp; I have sworn, and I will perform <i>it</i>, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>107</span>&ensp; I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>108</span>&ensp; Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>109</span>&ensp; My soul <i>is</i> continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>110</span>&ensp; The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>111</span>&ensp; Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they <i>are</i> the rejoicing of my heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>112</span>&ensp; I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, <i>even unto</i> the end.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>113</span>&ensp; I hate <i>vain</i> thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>114</span>&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>115</span>&ensp; Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>116</span>&ensp; Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>117</span>&ensp; Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>118</span>&ensp; Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit <i>is</i> falsehood.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>119</span>&ensp; Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth <i>like</i> dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>120</span>&ensp; My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>121</span>&ensp; I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>122</span>&ensp; Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>123</span>&ensp; Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>124</span>&ensp; Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>125</span>&ensp; I <i>am</i> thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>126</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> time for <i>thee</i>, LORD, to work: <i>for</i> they have made void thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>127</span>&ensp; Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>128</span>&ensp; Therefore I esteem all <i>thy</i> precepts <i>concerning</i> all <i>things to be</i> right; <i>and</i> I hate every false way.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>129</span>&ensp; Thy testimonies <i>are</i> wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>130</span>&ensp; The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>131</span>&ensp; I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>132</span>&ensp; Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>133</span>&ensp; Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>134</span>&ensp; Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>135</span>&ensp; Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>136</span>&ensp; Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>137</span>&ensp; Righteous <i>art</i> thou, O LORD, and upright <i>are</i> thy judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>138</span>&ensp; Thy testimonies <i>that</i> thou hast commanded <i>are</i> righteous and very faithful.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>139</span>&ensp; My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>140</span>&ensp; Thy word <i>is</i> very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>141</span>&ensp; I <i>am</i> small and despised: <i>yet</i> do not I forget thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>142</span>&ensp; Thy righteousness <i>is</i> an everlasting righteousness, and thy law <i>is</i> the truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>143</span>&ensp; Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: <i>yet</i> thy commandments <i>are</i> my delights.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>144</span>&ensp; The righteousness of thy testimonies <i>is</i> everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>145</span>&ensp; I cried with <i>my</i> whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>146</span>&ensp; I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>147</span>&ensp; I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>148</span>&ensp; Mine eyes prevent the <i>night</i> watches, that I might meditate in thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>149</span>&ensp; Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>150</span>&ensp; They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>151</span>&ensp; Thou <i>art</i> near, O LORD; and all thy commandments <i>are</i> truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>152</span>&ensp; Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>153</span>&ensp; Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>154</span>&ensp; Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>155</span>&ensp; Salvation <i>is</i> far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>156</span>&ensp; Great <i>are</i> thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>157</span>&ensp; Many <i>are</i> my persecutors and mine enemies; <i>yet</i> do I not decline from thy testimonies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>158</span>&ensp; I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>159</span>&ensp; Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>160</span>&ensp; Thy word <i>is</i> true <i>from</i> the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>161</span>&ensp; Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>162</span>&ensp; I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>163</span>&ensp; I hate and abhor lying: <i>but</i> thy law do I love.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>164</span>&ensp; Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>165</span>&ensp; Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>166</span>&ensp; LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>167</span>&ensp; My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>168</span>&ensp; I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways <i>are</i> before thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>169</span>&ensp; Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>170</span>&ensp; Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>171</span>&ensp; My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>172</span>&ensp; My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments <i>are</i> righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>173</span>&ensp; Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>174</span>&ensp; I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law <i>is</i> my delight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>175</span>&ensp; Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>176</span>&ensp; I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.</p>

<p class='intro'>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Which imagine mischiefs in <i>their</i> heart; continually are they gathered together <i>for</i> war.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison <i>is</i> under their lips. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; I said unto the LORD, Thou <i>art</i> my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; <i>lest</i> they exalt themselves. Selah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; <i>As for</i> the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow <i>him</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, <i>and</i> the right of the poor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.</p>
