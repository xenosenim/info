<h2>The New Testament</h2>

<h1>The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy</h1>
<a href='#g1'>1</a>&emsp;<a href='#g2'>2</a>&emsp;<a href='#g3'>3</a>&emsp;<a href='#g4'>4</a><br>

<h3><a name='g1'></a>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; To Timothy, <i>my</i> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; I thank God, whom I serve from <i>my</i> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Who hath saved us, and called <i>us</i> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <i>me</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>

<h3><a name='g2'></a>Chapter 2</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <i>this</i> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And if a man also strive for masteries, <i>yet</i> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <i>even</i> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <i>him</i>, we shall also live with <i>him</i>:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; If we suffer, we shall also reign with <i>him</i>: if we deny <i>him</i>, he also will deny us:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; If we believe not, <i>yet</i> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Of these things put <i>them</i> in remembrance, charging <i>them</i> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <i>but</i> to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; But shun profane <i>and</i> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, <i>and</i> prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i>men</i>, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; And <i>that</i> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>

<h3><a name='g3'></a>Chapter 3</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <i>men</i>, as theirs also was.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <i>them</i> all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <i>them</i>;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; All scripture <i>is</i> given by inspiration of God, and <i>is</i> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g4'></a>Chapter 4</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; I charge <i>thee</i> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And they shall turn away <i>their</i> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; I have fought a good fight, I have finished <i>my</i> course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <i>with thee</i>, and the books, <i>but</i> especially the parchments.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <i>men</i> forsook me: <i>I pray God</i> that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <i>that</i> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <i>me</i> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; The Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with thy spirit. Grace <i>be</i> with you. Amen.</p>
<p class='ps'>The second <i>epistle</i> unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time.</p>
