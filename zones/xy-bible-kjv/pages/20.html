<h3><a name='g1'></a>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; A wise <i>man</i> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of knowledge: <i>but</i> fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; And they lay wait for their <i>own</i> blood; they lurk privily for their <i>own</i> lives.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; So <i>are</i> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <i>which</i> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <i>saying</i>,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>

<h3><a name='g2'></a>Chapter 2</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <i>and</i> apply thine heart to understanding;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <i>and</i> liftest up thy voice for understanding;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <i>for</i> hid treasures;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <i>cometh</i> knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <i>he is</i> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; <i>yea</i>, every good path.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; To deliver thee from the way of the evil <i>man</i>, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Who rejoice to do evil, <i>and</i> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Whose ways <i>are</i> crooked, and <i>they</i> froward in their paths:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; To deliver thee from the strange woman, <i>even</i> from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; That thou mayest walk in the way of good <i>men</i>, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g3'></a>Chapter 3</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <i>in whom</i> he delighteth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Happy <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> findeth wisdom, and the man <i>that</i> getteth understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; For the merchandise of it <i>is</i> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand; <i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Her ways <i>are</i> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <i>are</i> peace.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; She <i>is</i> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <i>is every one</i> that retaineth her.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; For the froward <i>is</i> abomination to the LORD: but his secret <i>is</i> with the righteous.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; The curse of the LORD <i>is</i> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>

<h3><a name='g4'></a>Chapter 4</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; For I was my father's son, tender and only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <i>it</i> not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> the principal thing; <i>therefore</i> get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Take fast hold of instruction; let <i>her</i> not go: keep her; for she <i>is</i> thy life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <i>men</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause <i>some</i> to fall.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; But the path of the just <i>is</i> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; The way of the wicked <i>is</i> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; For they <i>are</i> life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it <i>are</i> the issues of life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g5'></a>Chapter 5</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; My son, attend unto my wisdom, <i>and</i> bow thine ear to my understanding:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; That thou mayest regard discretion, and <i>that</i> thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; For the lips of a strange woman drop <i>as</i> an honeycomb, and her mouth <i>is</i> smoother than oil:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, <i>that</i> thou canst not know <i>them</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours <i>be</i> in the house of a stranger;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, <i>and</i> rivers of waters in the streets.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; <i>Let her be as</i> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; For the ways of man <i>are</i> before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g6'></a>Chapter 6</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <i>if</i> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <i>of the hunter</i>, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Provideth her meat in the summer, <i>and</i> gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; <i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Frowardness <i>is</i> in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; These six <i>things</i> doth the LORD hate: yea, seven <i>are</i> an abomination unto him:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; A false witness <i>that</i> speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Bind them continually upon thine heart, <i>and</i> tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and <i>when</i> thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; For the commandment <i>is</i> a lamp; and the law <i>is</i> light; and reproofs of instruction <i>are</i> the way of life:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; For by means of a whorish woman <i>a man is brought</i> to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; <i>Men</i> do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; But <i>if</i> he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; <i>But</i> whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he <i>that</i> doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; For jealousy <i>is</i> the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>

<h3><a name='g7'></a>Chapter 7</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Say unto wisdom, Thou <i>art</i> my sister; and call understanding <i>thy</i> kinswoman:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And, behold, there met him a woman <i>with</i> the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; (She <i>is</i> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Now <i>is she</i> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; So she caught him, and kissed him, <i>and</i> with an impudent face said unto him,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; <i>I have</i> peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved <i>works</i>, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; For the goodman <i>is</i> not at home, he is gone a long journey:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; He hath taken a bag of money with him, <i>and</i> will come home at the day appointed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it <i>is</i> for his life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong <i>men</i> have been slain by her.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Her house <i>is</i> the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <i>is</i> to the sons of man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <i>shall be</i> right things.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <i>is</i> an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; All the words of my mouth <i>are</i> in righteousness; <i>there is</i> nothing froward or perverse in them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; They <i>are</i> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; For wisdom <i>is</i> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Counsel <i>is</i> mine, and sound wisdom: I <i>am</i> understanding; I have strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; By me princes rule, and nobles, <i>even</i> all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Riches and honour <i>are</i> with me; <i>yea</i>, durable riches and righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; My fruit <i>is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; When <i>there were</i> no depths, I was brought forth; when <i>there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; When he prepared the heavens, I <i>was</i> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; Then I was by him, <i>as</i> one brought up <i>with him</i>: and I was daily <i>his</i> delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <i>were</i> with the sons of men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <i>are they that</i> keep my ways.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked <i>man getteth</i> himself a blot.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Give <i>instruction</i> to a wise <i>man</i>, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just <i>man</i>, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy <i>is</i> understanding.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but <i>if</i> thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; A foolish woman <i>is</i> clamorous: <i>she is</i> simple, and knoweth nothing.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; To call passengers who go right on their ways:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Whoso <i>is</i> simple, let him turn in hither: and <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son <i>is</i> the heaviness of his mother.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; He becometh poor that dealeth <i>with</i> a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; He that gathereth in summer <i>is</i> a wise son: <i>but</i> he that sleepeth in harvest <i>is</i> a son that causeth shame.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Blessings <i>are</i> upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; The memory of the just <i>is</i> blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod <i>is</i> for the back of him that is void of understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Wise <i>men</i> lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish <i>is</i> near destruction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; The rich man's wealth <i>is</i> his strong city: the destruction of the poor <i>is</i> their poverty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The labour of the righteous <i>tendeth</i> to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; He <i>is in</i> the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; He that hideth hatred <i>with</i> lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, <i>is</i> a fool.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; As the whirlwind passeth, so <i>is</i> the wicked no <i>more</i>: but the righteous <i>is</i> an everlasting foundation.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; The hope of the righteous <i>shall be</i> gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; The way of the LORD <i>is</i> strength to the upright: but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; A wise son <i>heareth</i> his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; A man shall eat good by the fruit of <i>his</i> mouth: but the soul of the transgressors <i>shall eat</i> violence.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: <i>but</i> he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; The soul of the sluggard desireth, and <i>hath</i> nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; A righteous <i>man</i> hateth lying: but a wicked <i>man</i> is loathsome, and cometh to shame.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Righteousness keepeth <i>him that is</i> upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; There is that maketh himself rich, yet <i>hath</i> nothing: <i>there is</i> that maketh himself poor, yet <i>hath</i> great riches.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The ransom of a man's life <i>are</i> his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised <i>is</i> wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Wealth <i>gotten</i> by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but <i>when</i> the desire cometh, <i>it is</i> a tree of life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; The law of the wise <i>is</i> a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors <i>is</i> hard.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Every prudent <i>man</i> dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open <i>his</i> folly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador <i>is</i> health.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Poverty and shame <i>shall be to</i> him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but <i>it is</i> abomination to fools to depart from evil.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; He that walketh with wise <i>men</i> shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; A good <i>man</i> leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner <i>is</i> laid up for the just.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Much food <i>is in</i> the tillage of the poor: but there is <i>that is</i> destroyed for want of judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.</p>

<h3><a name='g14'></a>Chapter 14</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but <i>he that is</i> perverse in his ways despiseth him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; In the mouth of the foolish <i>is</i> a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Where no oxen <i>are</i>, the crib <i>is</i> clean: but much increase <i>is</i> by the strength of the ox.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; A scorner seeketh wisdom, and <i>findeth it</i> not: but knowledge <i>is</i> easy unto him that understandeth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not <i>in him</i> the lips of knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The wisdom of the prudent <i>is</i> to understand his way: but the folly of fools <i>is</i> deceit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous <i>there is</i> favour.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <i>are</i> the ways of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth <i>is</i> heaviness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man <i>shall be satisfied</i> from himself.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; The simple believeth every word: but the prudent <i>man</i> looketh well to his going.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; A wise <i>man</i> feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; <i>He that is</i> soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich <i>hath</i> many friends.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth <i>shall be</i> to them that devise good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips <i>tendeth</i> only to penury.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; The crown of the wise <i>is</i> their riches: <i>but</i> the foolishness of fools <i>is</i> folly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful <i>witness</i> speaketh lies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; In the fear of the LORD <i>is</i> strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; In the multitude of people <i>is</i> the king's honour: but in the want of people <i>is</i> the destruction of the prince.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; <i>He that is</i> slow to wrath <i>is</i> of great understanding: but <i>he that is</i> hasty of spirit exalteth folly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; A sound heart <i>is</i> the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but <i>that which is</i> in the midst of fools is made known.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin <i>is</i> a reproach to any people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; The king's favour <i>is</i> toward a wise servant: but his wrath is <i>against</i> him that causeth shame.</p>

<h3><a name='g15'></a>Chapter 15</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; The eyes of the LORD <i>are</i> in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; A wholesome tongue <i>is</i> a tree of life: but perverseness therein <i>is</i> a breach in the spirit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; In the house of the righteous <i>is</i> much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish <i>doeth</i> not so.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright <i>is</i> his delight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; The way of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Correction <i>is</i> grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: <i>and</i> he that hateth reproof shall die.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Hell and destruction <i>are</i> before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; All the days of the afflicted <i>are</i> evil: but he that is of a merry heart <i>hath</i> a continual feast.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Better <i>is</i> little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but <i>he that is</i> slow to anger appeaseth strife.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; The way of the slothful <i>man is</i> as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous <i>is</i> made plain.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Folly <i>is</i> joy to <i>him that is</i> destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word <i>spoken</i> in due season, how good <i>is it</i>!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; The way of life <i>is</i> above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; The thoughts of the wicked <i>are</i> an abomination to the LORD: but <i>the words</i> of the pure <i>are</i> pleasant words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: <i>and</i> a good report maketh the bones fat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the instruction of wisdom; and before honour <i>is</i> humility.</p>

<h3><a name='g16'></a>Chapter 16</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, <i>is</i> from the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; All the ways of a man <i>are</i> clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; The LORD hath made all <i>things</i> for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Every one <i>that is</i> proud in heart <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD: <i>though</i> hand <i>join</i> in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <i>men</i> depart from evil.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; A divine sentence <i>is</i> in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; A just weight and balance <i>are</i> the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag <i>are</i> his work.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Righteous lips <i>are</i> the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; The wrath of a king <i>is as</i> messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; In the light of the king's countenance <i>is</i> life; and his favour <i>is</i> as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; How much better <i>is it</i> to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; The highway of the upright <i>is</i> to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Pride <i>goeth</i> before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Better <i>it is to be</i> of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Understanding <i>is</i> a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools <i>is</i> folly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Pleasant words <i>are as</i> an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <i>are</i> the ways of death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips <i>there is</i> as a burning fire.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way <i>that is</i> not good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; The hoary head <i>is</i> a crown of glory, <i>if</i> it be found in the way of righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; <i>He that is</i> slow to anger <i>is</i> better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof <i>is</i> of the LORD.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g17'></a>Chapter 17</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices <i>with</i> strife.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; The fining pot <i>is</i> for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; <i>and</i> a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: <i>and</i> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Children's children <i>are</i> the crown of old men; and the glory of children <i>are</i> their fathers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; A gift <i>is as</i> a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth <i>very</i> friends.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; An evil <i>man</i> seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; The beginning of strife <i>is as</i> when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Wherefore <i>is there</i> a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing <i>he hath</i> no heart <i>to it</i>?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; A man void of understanding striketh hands, <i>and</i> becometh surety in the presence of his friend.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; He loveth transgression that loveth strife: <i>and</i> he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; He that begetteth a fool <i>doeth it</i> to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; A merry heart doeth good <i>like</i> a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; A wicked <i>man</i> taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool <i>are</i> in the ends of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; A foolish son <i>is</i> a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Also to punish the just <i>is</i> not good, <i>nor</i> to strike princes for equity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; He that hath knowledge spareth his words: <i>and</i> a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: <i>and</i> he that shutteth his lips <i>is esteemed</i> a man of understanding.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g18'></a>Chapter 18</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh <i>and</i> intermeddleth with all wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; When the wicked cometh, <i>then</i> cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; The words of a man's mouth <i>are as</i> deep waters, <i>and</i> the wellspring of wisdom <i>as</i> a flowing brook.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; A fool's mouth <i>is</i> his destruction, and his lips <i>are</i> the snare of his soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; The name of the LORD <i>is</i> a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; The rich man's wealth <i>is</i> his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour <i>is</i> humility.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; He that answereth a matter before he heareth <i>it</i>, it <i>is</i> folly and shame unto him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; <i>He that is</i> first in his own cause <i>seemeth</i> just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; A brother offended <i>is harder to be won</i> than a strong city: and <i>their</i> contentions <i>are</i> like the bars of a castle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; <i>and</i> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Death and life <i>are</i> in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; <i>Whoso</i> findeth a wife findeth a good <i>thing</i>, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; A man <i>that hath</i> friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend <i>that</i> sticketh closer than a brother.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Better <i>is</i> the poor that walketh in his integrity, than <i>he that is</i> perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Also, <i>that</i> the soul <i>be</i> without knowledge, <i>it is</i> not good; and he that hasteth with <i>his</i> feet sinneth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies shall not escape.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man <i>is</i> a friend to him that giveth gifts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth <i>them with</i> words, <i>yet</i> they <i>are</i> wanting <i>to him</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <i>he that</i> speaketh lies shall perish.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and <i>it is</i> his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; The king's wrath <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion; but his favour <i>is</i> as dew upon the grass.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; A foolish son <i>is</i> the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife <i>are</i> a continual dropping.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; House and riches <i>are</i> the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife <i>is</i> from the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; <i>but</i> he that despiseth his ways shall die.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver <i>him</i>, yet thou must do it again.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; <i>There are</i> many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; The desire of a man <i>is</i> his kindness: and a poor man <i>is</i> better than a liar.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>tendeth</i> to life: and <i>he that hath it</i> shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; A slothful <i>man</i> hideth his hand in <i>his</i> bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, <i>and</i> he will understand knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; He that wasteth <i>his</i> father, <i>and</i> chaseth away <i>his</i> mother, <i>is</i> a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Cease, my son, to hear the instruction <i>that causeth</i> to err from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</p>

<h3><a name='g20'></a>Chapter 20</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Wine <i>is</i> a mocker, strong drink <i>is</i> raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; The fear of a king <i>is</i> as the roaring of a lion: <i>whoso</i> provoketh him to anger sinneth <i>against</i> his own soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; <i>therefore</i> shall he beg in harvest, and <i>have</i> nothing.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Counsel in the heart of man <i>is like</i> deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; The just <i>man</i> walketh in his integrity: his children <i>are</i> blessed after him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Divers weights, <i>and</i> divers measures, both of them <i>are</i> alike abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <i>be</i> pure, and whether <i>it be</i> right.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, <i>and</i> thou shalt be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> naught, <i>it is</i> naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge <i>are</i> a precious jewel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Take his garment that is surety <i>for</i> a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Bread of deceit <i>is</i> sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; <i>Every</i> purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; He that goeth about <i>as</i> a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; An inheritance <i>may be</i> gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Say not thou, I will recompense evil; <i>but</i> wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Divers weights <i>are</i> an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance <i>is</i> not good.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Man's goings <i>are</i> of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> a snare to the man <i>who</i> devoureth <i>that which is</i> holy, and after vows to make enquiry.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; The spirit of man <i>is</i> the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; The glory of young men <i>is</i> their strength: and the beauty of old men <i>is</i> the gray head.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so <i>do</i> stripes the inward parts of the belly.</p>

<h3><a name='g21'></a>Chapter 21</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; The king's heart <i>is</i> in the hand of the LORD, <i>as</i> the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Every way of a man <i>is</i> right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; To do justice and judgment <i>is</i> more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; An high look, and a proud heart, <i>and</i> the plowing of the wicked, <i>is</i> sin.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; The thoughts of the diligent <i>tend</i> only to plenteousness; but of every one <i>that is</i> hasty only to want.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <i>is</i> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The way of man <i>is</i> froward and strange: but <i>as for</i> the pure, his work <i>is</i> right.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; The righteous <i>man</i> wisely considereth the house of the wicked: <i>but God</i> overthroweth the wicked for <i>their</i> wickedness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; He that loveth pleasure <i>shall be</i> a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; The wicked <i>shall be</i> a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; <i>There is</i> treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; A wise <i>man</i> scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Proud <i>and</i> haughty scorner <i>is</i> his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> abomination: how much more, <i>when</i> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; A wicked man hardeneth his face: but <i>as for</i> the upright, he directeth his way.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; <i>There is</i> no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; The horse <i>is</i> prepared against the day of battle: but safety <i>is</i> of the LORD.</p>

<h3><a name='g22'></a>Chapter 22</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; A <i>good</i> name <i>is</i> rather to be chosen than great riches, <i>and</i> loving favour rather than silver and gold.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; The rich and poor meet together: the LORD <i>is</i> the maker of them all.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; A prudent <i>man</i> foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; By humility <i>and</i> the fear of the LORD <i>are</i> riches, and honour, and life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Thorns <i>and</i> snares <i>are</i> in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower <i>is</i> servant to the lender.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; He that loveth pureness of heart, <i>for</i> the grace of his lips the king <i>shall be</i> his friend.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; The slothful <i>man</i> saith, <i>There is</i> a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; The mouth of strange women <i>is</i> a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Foolishness <i>is</i> bound in the heart of a child; <i>but</i> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; He that oppresseth the poor to increase his <i>riches, and</i> he that giveth to the rich, <i>shall</i> surely <i>come</i> to want.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; For <i>it is</i> a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Rob not the poor, because he <i>is</i> poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Be not thou <i>one</i> of them that strike hands, <i>or</i> of them that are sureties for debts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean <i>men</i>.</p>

<h3><a name='g23'></a>Chapter 23</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what <i>is</i> before thee:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <i>be</i> a man given to appetite.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Be not desirous of his dainties: for they <i>are</i> deceitful meat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for <i>riches</i> certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Eat thou not the bread of <i>him that hath</i> an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For as he thinketh in his heart, so <i>is</i> he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart <i>is</i> not with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The morsel <i>which</i> thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; For their redeemer <i>is</i> mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Withhold not correction from the child: for <i>if</i> thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Let not thine heart envy sinners: but <i>be thou</i> in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe <i>a man</i> with rags.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Buy the truth, and sell <i>it</i> not; <i>also</i> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise <i>child</i> shall have joy of him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; For a whore <i>is</i> a deep ditch; and a strange woman <i>is</i> a narrow pit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; She also lieth in wait as <i>for</i> a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, <i>when</i> it moveth itself aright.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; They have stricken me, <i>shalt thou say, and</i> I was not sick; they have beaten me, <i>and</i> I felt <i>it</i> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>

<h3><a name='g24'></a>Chapter 24</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; A wise man <i>is</i> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors <i>there is</i> safety.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; The thought of foolishness <i>is</i> sin: and the scorner <i>is</i> an abomination to men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; <i>If</i> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <i>is</i> small.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; If thou forbear to deliver <i>them that are</i> drawn unto death, and <i>those that are</i> ready to be slain;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider <i>it</i>? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth <i>not</i> he know <i>it</i>? and shall <i>not</i> he render to <i>every</i> man according to his works?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; My son, eat thou honey, because <i>it is</i> good; and the honeycomb, <i>which is</i> sweet to thy taste:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; So <i>shall</i> the knowledge of wisdom <i>be</i> unto thy soul: when thou hast found <i>it</i>, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Lay not wait, O wicked <i>man</i>, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; For a just <i>man</i> falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Lest the LORD see <i>it</i>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Fret not thyself because of evil <i>men</i>, neither be thou envious at the wicked;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; For there shall be no reward to the evil <i>man</i>; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: <i>and</i> meddle not with them that are given to change:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; These <i>things</i> also <i>belong</i> to the wise. <i>It is</i> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <i>art</i> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; <i>Every man</i> shall kiss <i>his</i> lips that giveth a right answer.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, <i>and</i> nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; <i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; These <i>are</i> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <i>is</i> to search out a matter.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <i>is</i> unsearchable.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Take away the wicked <i>from</i> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <i>men</i>:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For better <i>it is</i> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <i>thou know not</i> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <i>himself</i>; and discover not a secret to another:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Lest he that heareth <i>it</i> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; A word fitly spoken <i>is like</i> apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; <i>As</i> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <i>so is</i> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <i>so is</i> a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift <i>is like</i> clouds and wind without rain.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and <i>so</i> hate thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour <i>is</i> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble <i>is like</i> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; The north wind driveth away rain: so <i>doth</i> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; A righteous man falling down before the wicked <i>is as</i> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> not good to eat much honey: so <i>for men</i> to search their own glory <i>is not</i> glory.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, <i>and</i> drinketh damage.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; The sluggard <i>is</i> wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; He that passeth by, <i>and</i> meddleth with strife <i>belonging</i> not to him, <i>is like</i> one that taketh a dog by the ears.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; <i>As</i> coals <i>are</i> to burning coals, and wood to fire; so <i>is</i> a contentious man to kindle strife.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; The words of a talebearer <i>are</i> as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Burning lips and a wicked heart <i>are like</i> a potsherd covered with silver dross.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; For an odious <i>woman</i> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; There be four <i>things which are</i> little upon the earth, but they <i>are</i> exceeding wise:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; The ants <i>are</i> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; The conies <i>are but</i> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; There be three <i>things</i> which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; A lion <i>which is</i> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <i>there is</i> no rising up.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <i>lay</i> thine hand upon thy mouth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</p>

<h3><a name='g31'></a>Chapter 31</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; <i>It is</i> not for kings, O Lemuel, <i>it is</i> not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <i>is</i> far above rubies.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; She perceiveth that her merchandise <i>is</i> good: her candle goeth not out by night.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household <i>are</i> clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing <i>is</i> silk and purple.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; She maketh fine linen, and selleth <i>it</i>; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Strength and honour <i>are</i> her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue <i>is</i> the law of kindness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband <i>also</i>, and he praiseth her.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; Favour <i>is</i> deceitful, and beauty <i>is</i> vain: <i>but</i> a woman <i>that</i> feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>
