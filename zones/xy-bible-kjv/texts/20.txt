### <a name='g1'></a>Chapter 1
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; A wise <i>man</i> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of knowledge: <i>but</i> fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; And they lay wait for their <i>own</i> blood; they lurk privily for their <i>own</i> lives.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; So <i>are</i> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <i>which</i> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <i>saying</i>,</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p>%[dpb|33]&ensp; But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>

### <a name='g2'></a>Chapter 2
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <i>and</i> apply thine heart to understanding;</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <i>and</i> liftest up thy voice for understanding;</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <i>for</i> hid treasures;</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <i>cometh</i> knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <i>he is</i> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; <i>yea</i>, every good path.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; To deliver thee from the way of the evil <i>man</i>, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Who rejoice to do evil, <i>and</i> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Whose ways <i>are</i> crooked, and <i>they</i> froward in their paths:</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; To deliver thee from the strange woman, <i>even</i> from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words;</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; That thou mayest walk in the way of good <i>men</i>, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

### <a name='g3'></a>Chapter 3
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <i>in whom</i> he delighteth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Happy <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> findeth wisdom, and the man <i>that</i> getteth understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; For the merchandise of it <i>is</i> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand; <i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Her ways <i>are</i> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <i>are</i> peace.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; She <i>is</i> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <i>is every one</i> that retaineth her.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; For the froward <i>is</i> abomination to the LORD: but his secret <i>is</i> with the righteous.</p>
<p>%[dpb|33]&ensp; The curse of the LORD <i>is</i> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</p>
<p>%[dpb|34]&ensp; Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</p>
<p>%[dpb|35]&ensp; The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

### <a name='g4'></a>Chapter 4
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; For I was my father's son, tender and only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <i>it</i> not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> the principal thing; <i>therefore</i> get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Take fast hold of instruction; let <i>her</i> not go: keep her; for she <i>is</i> thy life.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <i>men</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause <i>some</i> to fall.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; But the path of the just <i>is</i> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; The way of the wicked <i>is</i> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; For they <i>are</i> life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it <i>are</i> the issues of life.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

### <a name='g5'></a>Chapter 5
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; My son, attend unto my wisdom, <i>and</i> bow thine ear to my understanding:</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; That thou mayest regard discretion, and <i>that</i> thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; For the lips of a strange woman drop <i>as</i> an honeycomb, and her mouth <i>is</i> smoother than oil:</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, <i>that</i> thou canst not know <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours <i>be</i> in the house of a stranger;</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, <i>and</i> rivers of waters in the streets.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; <i>Let her be as</i> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; For the ways of man <i>are</i> before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

### <a name='g6'></a>Chapter 6
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <i>if</i> thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <i>of the hunter</i>, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Provideth her meat in the summer, <i>and</i> gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; <i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Frowardness <i>is</i> in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; These six <i>things</i> doth the LORD hate: yea, seven <i>are</i> an abomination unto him:</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; A false witness <i>that</i> speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; Bind them continually upon thine heart, <i>and</i> tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and <i>when</i> thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; For the commandment <i>is</i> a lamp; and the law <i>is</i> light; and reproofs of instruction <i>are</i> the way of life:</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; For by means of a whorish woman <i>a man is brought</i> to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; <i>Men</i> do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; But <i>if</i> he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; <i>But</i> whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he <i>that</i> doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p>
<p>%[dpb|33]&ensp; A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p>%[dpb|34]&ensp; For jealousy <i>is</i> the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p>%[dpb|35]&ensp; He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

### <a name='g7'></a>Chapter 7
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; Say unto wisdom, Thou <i>art</i> my sister; and call understanding <i>thy</i> kinswoman:</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; And, behold, there met him a woman <i>with</i> the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; (She <i>is</i> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; Now <i>is she</i> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; So she caught him, and kissed him, <i>and</i> with an impudent face said unto him,</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; <i>I have</i> peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved <i>works</i>, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; For the goodman <i>is</i> not at home, he is gone a long journey:</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; He hath taken a bag of money with him, <i>and</i> will come home at the day appointed.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it <i>is</i> for his life.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>

<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <i>is</i> to the sons of man.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <i>shall be</i> right things.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <i>is</i> an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; All the words of my mouth <i>are</i> in righteousness; <i>there is</i> nothing froward or perverse in them.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; They <i>are</i> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; For wisdom <i>is</i> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Counsel <i>is</i> mine, and sound wisdom: I <i>am</i> understanding; I have strength.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; By me princes rule, and nobles, <i>even</i> all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Riches and honour <i>are</i> with me; <i>yea</i>, durable riches and righteousness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; My fruit <i>is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; When <i>there were</i> no depths, I was brought forth; when <i>there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; When he prepared the heavens, I <i>was</i> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; Then I was by him, <i>as</i> one brought up <i>with him</i>: and I was daily <i>his</i> delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <i>were</i> with the sons of men.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <i>are they that</i> keep my ways.</p>
<p>%[dpb|33]&ensp; Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p>%[dpb|34]&ensp; Blessed <i>is</i> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p>%[dpb|35]&ensp; For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</p>
<p>%[dpb|36]&ensp; But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p>

<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked <i>man getteth</i> himself a blot.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Give <i>instruction</i> to a wise <i>man</i>, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just <i>man</i>, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy <i>is</i> understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but <i>if</i> thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; A foolish woman <i>is</i> clamorous: <i>she is</i> simple, and knoweth nothing.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; To call passengers who go right on their ways:</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Whoso <i>is</i> simple, let him turn in hither: and <i>as for</i> him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Stolen waters are sweet, and bread <i>eaten</i> in secret is pleasant.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; But he knoweth not that the dead <i>are</i> there; <i>and that</i> her guests <i>are</i> in the depths of hell.</p>

<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.</p>

<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; <i>It is</i> as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>

<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so <i>is</i> the sluggard to them that send him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; The hope of the righteous <i>shall be</i> gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; The way of the LORD <i>is</i> strength to the upright: but destruction <i>shall be</i> to the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; The eyes of the LORD <i>are</i> in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; A wholesome tongue <i>is</i> a tree of life: but perverseness therein <i>is</i> a breach in the spirit.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; In the house of the righteous <i>is</i> much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish <i>doeth</i> not so.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright <i>is</i> his delight.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; The way of the wicked <i>is</i> an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Correction <i>is</i> grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: <i>and</i> he that hateth reproof shall die.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; Hell and destruction <i>are</i> before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; All the days of the afflicted <i>are</i> evil: but he that is of a merry heart <i>hath</i> a continual feast.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but <i>he that is</i> slow to anger appeaseth strife.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; The way of the slothful <i>man is</i> as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous <i>is</i> made plain.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; Folly <i>is</i> joy to <i>him that is</i> destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.</p>

<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; The thoughts of the wicked <i>are</i> an abomination to the LORD: but <i>the words</i> of the pure <i>are</i> pleasant words.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; The LORD <i>is</i> far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: <i>and</i> a good report maketh the bones fat.</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|33]&ensp; The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the instruction of wisdom; and before honour <i>is</i> humility.</p>

<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; The LORD hath made all <i>things</i> for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Every one <i>that is</i> proud in heart <i>is</i> an abomination to the LORD: <i>though</i> hand <i>join</i> in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <i>men</i> depart from evil.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; A divine sentence <i>is</i> in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; A just weight and balance <i>are</i> the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag <i>are</i> his work.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; <i>It is</i> an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Righteous lips <i>are</i> the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; The wrath of a king <i>is as</i> messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; In the light of the king's countenance <i>is</i> life; and his favour <i>is</i> as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; How much better <i>is it</i> to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; The highway of the upright <i>is</i> to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Pride <i>goeth</i> before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; Better <i>it is to be</i> of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; Understanding <i>is</i> a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools <i>is</i> folly.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Pleasant words <i>are as</i> an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof <i>are</i> the ways of death.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips <i>there is</i> as a burning fire.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way <i>that is</i> not good.</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; The hoary head <i>is</i> a crown of glory, <i>if</i> it be found in the way of righteousness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; <i>He that is</i> slow to anger <i>is</i> better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p>

<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; The fining pot <i>is</i> for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; <i>and</i> a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: <i>and</i> he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Children's children <i>are</i> the crown of old men; and the glory of children <i>are</i> their fathers.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; A gift <i>is as</i> a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth <i>very</i> friends.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; An evil <i>man</i> seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; The beginning of strife <i>is as</i> when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both <i>are</i> abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Wherefore <i>is there</i> a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing <i>he hath</i> no heart <i>to it</i>?</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; A man void of understanding striketh hands, <i>and</i> becometh surety in the presence of his friend.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; He loveth transgression that loveth strife: <i>and</i> he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; He that begetteth a fool <i>doeth it</i> to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; A merry heart doeth good <i>like</i> a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; A wicked <i>man</i> taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool <i>are</i> in the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; A foolish son <i>is</i> a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; Also to punish the just <i>is</i> not good, <i>nor</i> to strike princes for equity.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; He that hath knowledge spareth his words: <i>and</i> a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: <i>and</i> he that shutteth his lips <i>is esteemed</i> a man of understanding.</p>

<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; He that answereth a matter before he heareth <i>it</i>, it <i>is</i> folly and shame unto him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>

<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; A brother offended <i>is harder to be won</i> than a strong city: and <i>their</i> contentions <i>are</i> like the bars of a castle.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; <i>and</i> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</p>

<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <i>is</i> a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; The way of man <i>is</i> froward and strange: but <i>as for</i> the pure, his work <i>is</i> right.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; The righteous <i>man</i> wisely considereth the house of the wicked: <i>but God</i> overthroweth the wicked for <i>their</i> wickedness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.</p>

<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; <i>There is</i> treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; A wise <i>man</i> scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Proud <i>and</i> haughty scorner <i>is</i> his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; The sacrifice of the wicked <i>is</i> abomination: how much more, <i>when</i> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; A wicked man hardeneth his face: but <i>as for</i> the upright, he directeth his way.</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; <i>There is</i> no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.</p>

### <a name='g22'></a>Chapter 22
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; A <i>good</i> name <i>is</i> rather to be chosen than great riches, <i>and</i> loving favour rather than silver and gold.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; The rich and poor meet together: the LORD <i>is</i> the maker of them all.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; A prudent <i>man</i> foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; By humility <i>and</i> the fear of the LORD <i>are</i> riches, and honour, and life.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Thorns <i>and</i> snares <i>are</i> in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower <i>is</i> servant to the lender.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; He that loveth pureness of heart, <i>for</i> the grace of his lips the king <i>shall be</i> his friend.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; The slothful <i>man</i> saith, <i>There is</i> a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; The mouth of strange women <i>is</i> a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Foolishness <i>is</i> bound in the heart of a child; <i>but</i> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; He that oppresseth the poor to increase his <i>riches, and</i> he that giveth to the rich, <i>shall</i> surely <i>come</i> to want.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; For <i>it is</i> a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; Rob not the poor, because he <i>is</i> poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; Be not thou <i>one</i> of them that strike hands, <i>or</i> of them that are sureties for debts.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what <i>is</i> before thee:</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <i>be</i> a man given to appetite.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Be not desirous of his dainties: for they <i>are</i> deceitful meat.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for <i>riches</i> certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Eat thou not the bread of <i>him that hath</i> an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; For as he thinketh in his heart, so <i>is</i> he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart <i>is</i> not with thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; The morsel <i>which</i> thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; For their redeemer <i>is</i> mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; Withhold not correction from the child: for <i>if</i> thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Let not thine heart envy sinners: but <i>be thou</i> in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe <i>a man</i> with rags.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; Buy the truth, and sell <i>it</i> not; <i>also</i> wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise <i>child</i> shall have joy of him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; For a whore <i>is</i> a deep ditch; and a strange woman <i>is</i> a narrow pit.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; She also lieth in wait as <i>for</i> a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, <i>when</i> it moveth itself aright.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</p>
<p>%[dpb|33]&ensp; Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
<p>%[dpb|34]&ensp; Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</p>
<p>%[dpb|35]&ensp; They have stricken me, <i>shalt thou say, and</i> I was not sick; they have beaten me, <i>and</i> I felt <i>it</i> not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>

<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; A wise man <i>is</i> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors <i>there is</i> safety.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Wisdom <i>is</i> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; The thought of foolishness <i>is</i> sin: and the scorner <i>is</i> an abomination to men.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; <i>If</i> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <i>is</i> small.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; If thou forbear to deliver <i>them that are</i> drawn unto death, and <i>those that are</i> ready to be slain;</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider <i>it</i>? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth <i>not</i> he know <i>it</i>? and shall <i>not</i> he render to <i>every</i> man according to his works?</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; My son, eat thou honey, because <i>it is</i> good; and the honeycomb, <i>which is</i> sweet to thy taste:</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; So <i>shall</i> the knowledge of wisdom <i>be</i> unto thy soul: when thou hast found <i>it</i>, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; Lay not wait, O wicked <i>man</i>, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; For a just <i>man</i> falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Lest the LORD see <i>it</i>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; Fret not thyself because of evil <i>men</i>, neither be thou envious at the wicked;</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; For there shall be no reward to the evil <i>man</i>; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: <i>and</i> meddle not with them that are given to change:</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; These <i>things</i> also <i>belong</i> to the wise. <i>It is</i> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <i>art</i> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; But to them that rebuke <i>him</i> shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; <i>Every man</i> shall kiss <i>his</i> lips that giveth a right answer.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive <i>not</i> with thy lips.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, <i>and</i> nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; Then I saw, <i>and</i> considered <i>it</i> well: I looked upon <i>it, and</i> received instruction.</p>
<p>%[dpb|33]&ensp; <i>Yet</i> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p>%[dpb|34]&ensp; So shall thy poverty come <i>as</i> one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.</p>

<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; These <i>are</i> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; <i>It is</i> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings <i>is</i> to search out a matter.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings <i>is</i> unsearchable.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Take away the wicked <i>from</i> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great <i>men</i>:</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; For better <i>it is</i> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <i>thou know not</i> what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <i>himself</i>; and discover not a secret to another:</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Lest he that heareth <i>it</i> put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; A word fitly spoken <i>is like</i> apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; <i>As</i> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <i>so is</i> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <i>so is</i> a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift <i>is like</i> clouds and wind without rain.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and <i>so</i> hate thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour <i>is</i> a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble <i>is like</i> a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; <i>As</i> he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, <i>and as</i> vinegar upon nitre, so <i>is</i> he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; The north wind driveth away rain: so <i>doth</i> an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; <i>It is</i> better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; <i>As</i> cold waters to a thirsty soul, so <i>is</i> good news from a far country.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; A righteous man falling down before the wicked <i>is as</i> a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; <i>It is</i> not good to eat much honey: so <i>for men</i> to search their own glory <i>is not</i> glory.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; He that <i>hath</i> no rule over his own spirit <i>is like</i> a city <i>that is</i> broken down, <i>and</i> without walls.</p>

<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, <i>which</i> bewrayeth <i>itself</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; As in water face <i>answereth</i> to face, so the heart of man to man.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; <i>As</i> the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so <i>is</i> a man to his praise.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, <i>yet</i> will not his foolishness depart from him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, <i>and</i> look well to thy herds.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; For riches <i>are</i> not for ever: and doth the crown <i>endure</i> to every generation?</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; The lambs <i>are</i> for thy clothing, and the goats <i>are</i> the price of the field.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; And <i>thou shalt have</i> goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and <i>for</i> the maintenance for thy maidens.</p>

### <a name='g28'></a>Chapter 28
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; For the transgression of a land many <i>are</i> the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding <i>and</i> knowledge the state <i>thereof</i> shall be prolonged.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; A poor man that oppresseth the poor <i>is like</i> a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all <i>things</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Better <i>is</i> the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than <i>he that is</i> perverse <i>in his</i> ways, though he <i>be</i> rich.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Whoso keepeth the law <i>is</i> a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous <i>men</i> shameth his father.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer <i>shall be</i> abomination.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good <i>things</i> in possession.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; The rich man <i>is</i> wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; When righteous <i>men</i> do rejoice, <i>there is</i> great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh <i>them</i> shall have mercy.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; Happy <i>is</i> the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; <i>As</i> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; <i>so is</i> a wicked ruler over the poor people.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; The prince that wanteth understanding <i>is</i> also a great oppressor: <i>but</i> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <i>his</i> days.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; A man that doeth violence to the blood of <i>any</i> person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but <i>he that is</i> perverse <i>in his</i> ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain <i>persons</i> shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; To have respect of persons <i>is</i> not good: for for a piece of bread <i>that</i> man will transgress.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; He that hasteth to be rich <i>hath</i> an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, <i>It is</i> no transgression; the same <i>is</i> the companion of a destroyer.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>

### <a name='g29'></a>Chapter 29
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; He, that being often reproved hardeneth <i>his</i> neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth <i>his</i> substance.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; In the transgression of an evil man <i>there is</i> a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: <i>but</i> the wicked regardeth not to know <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise <i>men</i> turn away wrath.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; <i>If</i> a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, <i>there is</i> no rest.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise <i>man</i> keepeth it in till afterwards.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants <i>are</i> wicked.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left <i>to himself</i> bringeth his mother to shame.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; Where <i>there is</i> no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy <i>is</i> he.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; Seest thou a man <i>that is</i> hasty in his words? <i>there is</i> more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become <i>his</i> son at the length.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth <i>it</i> not.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; Many seek the ruler's favour; but <i>every</i> man's judgment <i>cometh</i> from the LORD.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; An unjust man <i>is</i> an abomination to the just: and <i>he that is</i> upright in the way <i>is</i> abomination to the wicked.</p>

### <a name='g30'></a>Chapter 30
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <i>even</i> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; Surely I <i>am</i> more brutish than <i>any</i> man, and have not the understanding of a man.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what <i>is</i> his name, and what <i>is</i> his son's name, if thou canst tell?</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Every word of God <i>is</i> pure: he <i>is</i> a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Two <i>things</i> have I required of thee; deny me <i>them</i> not before I die:</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Lest I be full, and deny <i>thee</i>, and say, Who <i>is</i> the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <i>in vain</i>.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a generation <i>that</i> curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a generation <i>that are</i> pure in their own eyes, and <i>yet</i> is not washed from their filthiness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; <i>There is</i> a generation, whose teeth <i>are as</i> swords, and their jaw teeth <i>as</i> knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <i>among</i> men.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; The horseleach hath two daughters, <i>crying</i>, Give, give. There are three <i>things that</i> are never satisfied, <i>yea</i>, four <i>things</i> say not, <i>It is</i> enough:</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <i>that</i> is not filled with water; and the fire <i>that</i> saith not, <i>It is</i> enough.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; The eye <i>that</i> mocketh at <i>his</i> father, and despiseth to obey <i>his</i> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; There be three <i>things which</i> are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; Such <i>is</i> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; For three <i>things</i> the earth is disquieted, and for four <i>which</i> it cannot bear:</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; For an odious <i>woman</i> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; There be four <i>things which are</i> little upon the earth, but they <i>are</i> exceeding wise:</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; The ants <i>are</i> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; The conies <i>are but</i> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; There be three <i>things</i> which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; A lion <i>which is</i> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <i>there is</i> no rising up.</p>
<p>%[dpb|32]&ensp; If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <i>lay</i> thine hand upon thy mouth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|33]&ensp; Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</p>

### <a name='g31'></a>Chapter 31
<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; <i>It is</i> not for kings, O Lemuel, <i>it is</i> not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <i>is</i> far above rubies.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>
<p>%[dpb|15]&ensp; She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>
<p>%[dpb|16]&ensp; She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>
<p>%[dpb|17]&ensp; She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</p>
<p>%[dpb|18]&ensp; She perceiveth that her merchandise <i>is</i> good: her candle goeth not out by night.</p>
<p>%[dpb|19]&ensp; She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>
<p>%[dpb|20]&ensp; She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p>%[dpb|21]&ensp; She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household <i>are</i> clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p>%[dpb|22]&ensp; She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing <i>is</i> silk and purple.</p>
<p>%[dpb|23]&ensp; Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p>%[dpb|24]&ensp; She maketh fine linen, and selleth <i>it</i>; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>
<p>%[dpb|25]&ensp; Strength and honour <i>are</i> her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p>%[dpb|26]&ensp; She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue <i>is</i> the law of kindness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|27]&ensp; She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>
<p>%[dpb|28]&ensp; Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband <i>also</i>, and he praiseth her.</p>
<p>%[dpb|29]&ensp; Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</p>
<p>%[dpb|30]&ensp; Favour <i>is</i> deceitful, and beauty <i>is</i> vain: <i>but</i> a woman <i>that</i> feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>
<p>%[dpb|31]&ensp; Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>
