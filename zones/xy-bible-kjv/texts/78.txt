# The Third Epistle of John

<p>%[dpb|1]&ensp; The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|2]&ensp; Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|3]&ensp; For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|4]&ensp; I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|5]&ensp; Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>
<p>%[dpb|6]&ensp; Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</p>
<p>%[dpb|7]&ensp; Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>%[dpb|8]&ensp; We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</p>
<p>%[dpb|9]&ensp; I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>
<p>%[dpb|10]&ensp; Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth <i>them</i> out of the church.</p>
<p>%[dpb|11]&ensp; Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
<p>%[dpb|12]&ensp; Demetrius hath good report of all <i>men</i>, and of the truth itself: yea, and we <i>also</i> bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
<p>%[dpb|13]&ensp; I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
<p>%[dpb|14]&ensp; But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace <i>be</i> to thee. <i>Our</i> friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>
