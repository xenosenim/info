<h1>04.Buying</h1>
<p class="subheading">Getting your first bitcoins.</p>

<p>The best way to get started with bitcoin is to <em>start using it</em>.</p>
<p>After you’ve got yourself a wallet, you’re ready to get your first bitcoins.</p>

<p class="note tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> A <em>satoshi</em> is the smallest unit of bitcoin
 (0.00000001 BTC). When it comes to buying bitcoin it’s more practical
to think in terms of satoshis rather than in <em>whole</em> bitcoins.
</p>
<h2>How can you buy bitcoin?</h2>
<p>The simplest way to buy bitcoin is to <strong>buy them from someone who has them</strong>. This is the best method for buying bitcoin (if you can find someone).</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/04.buy-bitcoin-person.gif'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/04.buy-bitcoin-person.gif'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Just give someone some money and your address, and they can create a transaction to send you some bitcoin.</p>


<p class="note tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Always wait for the transaction to get at least 1 confirmation. This means the transaction has been mined in to the blockchain and cannot be undone.
</p>
<p>But of course, not everyone knows someone has bitcoins to sell, so what are your options?</p>
<p>Well, there are companies that have popped up that sell bitcoin for a living. These places offer the most <em>convenient</em> way to buy bitcoin.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/04.buy-bitcoin-company.gif'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/04.buy-bitcoin-company.gif'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Visit a website, create an account, send them money, and they will “add bitcoins” to your account.</p>


<h2>Where can you buy bitcoin?</h2>
<p>The following are my recommendations for places to buy bitcoin as of <strong>February 2023</strong>. It’s not an extensive list, but they’re my personal recommendations.</p>
<p>They’re organised by the level of <em>privacy</em> they offer, which I think is the most important consideration when buying bitcoin (see Privacy below).</p>
<h3>A. No Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Binance  - Large company.</li>
<li>Coinbase - Mostly worldwide, highly popular, but not a fan myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are large companies that make it easy to sign up and buy
bitcoin. They’re convenient, but they require ID, and most likely work
with governments to share your data.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they’re hard to beat for getting your first bitcoins easily.</p>
<h3>B. Semi-Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Local Bitcoins - <strong>My top recommendation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m a big fan of Local Bitcoins. They pair you with other people who
want to buy and sell bitcoin, so instead of buying from them directly,
they help you to find other people to trade with. This is more in the
spirit of bitcoin.</p>

<h3>C. High Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bisq</li>
<li>Hodl Hodl</li>
</ul>
<p>These are <em>decentralised exchanges</em> that aim to fill the gap
that Local Bitcoins left behind. They pair you with other people looking
 to trade, but do not require ID, and instead use other mechanisms to
try and ensure honest trading.</p>
<p>These exchanges are trickier to use and do not have as many traders,
so the prices for coins are usually not as competitive. If you’re a
complete beginner I wouldn’t recommend starting with these, but they are
 a perfectly valid option if you’re looking for maximum privacy for your
 coins.</p>
<h2>Important Notes:</h2>
<p>Here are two important things to note when buying bitcoin:</p>
<h3>1. Owning Bitcoin</h3>


<p>When you buy bitcoin from a website, they will most likely add the
bitcoins to your “online wallet”. This is typical, but it’s important to
 be aware that these bitcoins <strong>do not fully belong to you</strong>. It may seem that you have the bitcoins in your account, but really they are in the possession of the company.</p>
<p>It’s like buying gold from a website, but only seeing the amount of
gold in your account, and not actually having the gold in your hands. So
 if the bitcoin company’s computers were to blow up, get hacked, or if
the company just plain-old disappears, then your bitcoins are gone too.</p>
<p>So what can you do?</p>
<p>Well, if you want to have complete <em>control</em> over you bitcoins (which I recommend), then <em>withdraw</em> the bitcoins to your own wallet. By “withdrawing” you are asking the company to create a transaction to lock up an amount of bitcoins to one of your addresses. As a result, you will have the keys that allow you to transfer the bitcoins, which means that nobody else has control of them except for you.</p>

<p class='clFigcaption'>If the bitcoins are in your wallet, the gold is in your hands.</p>


<p class="note text">
Having complete ownership and control of money is what fascinates me
about Bitcoin. This is why I recommend withdrawing bitcoins from an
online account to your wallet, as this is what gives you the freedom of
control that Bitcoin was designed for.
</p>
<p class="note text">
By withdrawing to your wallet, you are now also in control of the <em>security</em> of those bitcoins.
</p>


<h3>2. Privacy</h3>


<p>When you buy bitcoins from a company, they’re probably going to ask you to give them your ID.</p>
<p>Why? Because bitcoin is money, and governments like surveillance over
 money. Bitcoin operates outside of the banking system, and they cannot
control it, so the best thing governments can do is to monitor the
“bridges” in to the digital currency instead.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/04.exchange-bridge.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/04.exchange-bridge.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Companies that sell bitcoin are the bridges in to a separate monetary system.</p>


<p>Anyway, long story short, if you buy bitcoins from a place that asks
for your ID, then you can consider any bitcoins you buy from them as
being “tagged” to your ID.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
<p>Well, let’s say you decide to send those bitcoins to a secret shop.
That’s cool, but if that secret shop ever got raided (for whatever
reason) and their bitcoins/addresses were found, it would be possible to
 see all the transactions that the shop had received. As a result,
seeing as your bitcoins were tagged to your ID, it would be possible to
find out that <em>you</em> sent bitcoins to that shop.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/04.id-privacy-transaction.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/04.id-privacy-transaction.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>I’m not trying to dissuade you from buying bitcoins from companies
that ask for your ID, but it’s important to be aware of how they
operate. Just remember that bitcoin transactions are connected together,
 and so the privacy of your coins depends on you not <em>creating links from your identity</em> to the addresses you use.</p>
<p></p>
Bitcoin can be used anonymously, but only if you are cautions to not tie
 your identity to any addresses that you use. By buying bitcoins from a
company that requires your ID, you are <strong>sacrificing your privacy for convenience</strong>.

</details>
<p>I do not believe that ID-requiring companies have the true spirit of
Bitcoin at heart, but they do make for a convenient and easy way to get
your first bitcoins.</p>

<h2>Conclusion.</h2>
<p>The best way to buy bitcoin is with people you know and trust. Meet people<sup>1</sup>,
 make friends, and trade things. This is the purest form of trade, and
it’s the ultimate way to buy and sell bitcoin… if you can.</p>
<p>Companies offer a convenient way to buy bitcoin, but you pay for that
 convenience with your privacy. Be aware of this when you use the coins
you buy from them to pay for something. Furthermore, the coins in your
online wallet are not in your control, so <strong>withdraw</strong> them to your own wallet if you want them to actually be <em>your</em> coins.</p>
<p class="note text">
<strong>Note:</strong> A popular phrase in Bitcoin is “not your keys, not your coins”. In other words, if you don’t have the private keys needed to send the bitcoins in a transaction, then you technically do not have ownership of them.
</p>
<p>The places you can buy bitcoin from changes all the time, and varies
depending on where you live. The ones I’ve listed above are my best
suggestions, but there may be better options out there for you. It’s
always good to have a look around.</p>
