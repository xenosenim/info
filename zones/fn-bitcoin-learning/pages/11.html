<h1>11.Difficulty</h1>
<p class="subheading">A mechanism for regulating the time it takes to mine a block.</p>

<h2>What is the difficulty?</h2>
<p class="note important">
The <span class="term">difficulty</span> is a number that regulates how long it takes for miners to add new <span class="term">blocks</span> of transactions to the <span class="term">blockchain</span>.
</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/11.00-difficulty.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.00-difficulty.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>This difficulty value updates every 2 weeks to ensure that it takes
10 minutes (on average) to add a new block to the blockchain.</p>

<h2>Why is the difficulty important?</h2>
<p class="note important">
Because it ensures that blocks of transactions are added to the
blockchain at regular intervals, even as more miners join the network.
</p>
<p>If the difficulty remained the same, it would take less time between
adding new blocks to the blockchain as new miners join the network.</p>
<h2>When does the difficulty change?</h2>
<p class="note important">
The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks (roughly every 2 weeks).
</p>
<p>At this interval, each <span class="term">node</span> takes the
expected time for these 2016 blocks to be mined (2016 x 10 minutes), and
 divides it by the actual time it took (however many minutes):</p>
<pre class="math"><code>expected / actual
20160 / actual</code></pre>
<p>If miners were able to solve each block more quickly than expected;
say 9 minutes per block for example, you’d get a number like this</p>
<pre class="math"><code>20160 / 18144 = 1.11</code></pre>
<p>Each node then uses this number to adjust the difficulty for the next 2016 blocks:</p>
<pre class="math"><code>difficulty x 1.11 = new difficulty</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If the number is greater than 1 (i.e.&nbsp;blocks were mined quicker than expected), the difficulty increases.</li>
<li>If the number is less than 1 (i.e.&nbsp;blocks were mined slower than expected) the difficulty decreases.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it. Every miner on the bitcoin network now works with this new difficulty for the next 2016 blocks.</p>
<p class="note text">
The difficulty will only adjust by a factor of 4 at most (i.e.&nbsp;a
number not greater than 4 or less than 0.25). This is to prevent abrupt
changes from one difficulty to the next.
</p>
<h2>How does the difficulty control time between blocks?</h2>
<p>Okay, I’ll start with a simple example and go from there.</p>
<h3>1. Simple example</h3>
<p>Let’s say I give you a range of numbers from 1 to 100.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/11.01-range.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.01-range.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>Now, you are able to randomly generate a number between 1 and 100 <em>once every minute</em>. And <strong>your goal is to generate a number below my <span class="term">target</span> number</strong>.</p>
<p>So let’s say I set the target at <strong>50</strong>:</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/11.01-range_target.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.01-range_target.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>Seeing as you’re only able to generate a number between 1 and 100 <em>once a minute</em>, this should take you <strong>2 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p>But that’s too easy. Now I lower the target to <strong>20</strong>, which means you’re only going to be able to generate a winning number 1/5 of the time, or once every <strong>5 minutes</strong>:</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/11.01-range_target_20.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.01-range_target_20.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The lower the target, the more <em>difficult</em> it gets to generate a winning number.</p>


<p class="note text">
It’s not going to be 5 minutes every time because you could get lucky with the first number you generate. But <em>over the long run</em> it will work out to be 5-minute intervals.
</p>
<p>Therefore, based on how many numbers you are able to generate per
minute, I can use the height of the target to control how long it takes
you to find a winning number.</p>
<h4>Introducing the difficulty…</h4>
<p>I’m a computer, and instead of telling you the target value <em>directly</em>, I find it easier to give you the target by <strong>dividing the range of numbers with <em>a new number</em></strong>…</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/11.01-range_target_difficulty.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.01-range_target_difficulty.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>This new number is able to control the height of the target.</p>


<p class="note important">
This new number is the <span class="term">difficulty</span>, and it’s used as an easy way for me to modify the height of the target.
</p>
<p>Here’s the equation for finding the target:</p>
<pre><code>target = targetmax / difficulty</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, I can use this <span class="term">difficulty</span> value to help me set the target to any level I want:</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/11.01-range_target_difficulty_examples.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.01-range_target_difficulty_examples.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The higher the difficulty, the lower the target.</p>


<p>So I use the <span class="term">difficulty</span> to control the <span class="term">target</span>, and therefore how long it takes for you to generate a winning number.</p>
<h3>2. Bitcoin example.</h3>
<p>The difficulty in bitcoin works in exactly the same way – it’s used
to set a target value, and miners keep generating numbers (hashing their
 candidate blocks) in the hope that they will find a number lower than this target value:</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/11.02-bitcoin_target_hash.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.02-bitcoin_target_hash.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>And seeing as <em>miners are able to generate thousands of numbers</em> (hash values) per minute, bitcoin uses ridiculously big numbers:</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/11.02-bitcoin_range.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.02-bitcoin_range.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The numbers in bitcoin are just on a much bigger scale.</p>


<p>And due to the fact that there are now thousands of miners trying to
find winning numbers, to ensure that a winning number is found every 10
minutes (instead of every few seconds), the range of successful numbers
ends up being absolutely tiny:</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/11.02-bitcoin_range_target.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.02-bitcoin_range_target.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Even though that difficulty number looks big, the target is still absurdly difficult to get under. It’s like a lottery.</p>


<h4>Introducing hexadecimal numbers…</h4>
<p>Because these target numbers are so big, computers prefer to work with them in hexadecimal format.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/11.02-bitcoin_range_target_hex.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.02-bitcoin_range_target_hex.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>That’s why the hash values for blocks look like this: <code>000000000003ba27aa200b1cecaad478d2b00432346c3f1f3986da1afd33e506</code> – it’s hexadecimal.</p>
<p>And even though it’s got letters in there, it’s still a number. So the target is a hexadecimal value, and miners are <em>trying to get a <strong>hexadecimal hash value</strong> below the target</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, you can easily convert between hexadecimal and “normal numbers” (better known as decimal numbers):</p>

<div class="note text">
<p>Awkwardly, the difficulty is usually given in decimal format, whereas
 the hashes and targets are stored in hexadecimal. But as I say, they’re
 both numbers, and as long as you convert them to the same format you
can still work with them.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/11.blockheader_hexadecimal_decimal.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/11.blockheader_hexadecimal_decimal.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Block 100,000 header. The target is hexadecimal, but it is stored in a <em>compact</em> format in the block header (called <span class="term">bits</span>).</p>


</div>
<h2>
Example: Finding the target using the difficulty.
</h2>


<p>Let’s work out target for block 100,000 using the difficulty. But let’s do it mostly in decimal numbers, because they’re easier to understand.</p>
<p>Here’s the difficulty for block 100,000 (as found in the block header):</p>
<pre><code>{
"hash" : "000000000003ba27aa200b1cecaad478d2b00432346c3f1f3986da1afd33e506",
"height" : 100000,
"difficulty" : 14484.16236123,
}</code></pre>
<p>Lovely.</p>
<p>Now, let’s note down the equation we’re going to use to find the target:</p>
<pre class="math"><code>target = targetmax / difficulty</code></pre>
<p>And let’s get the targetmax and difficulty ready to insert it in to the equation.</p>
<pre><code>targetmax = 0x00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
difficulty = 14484.162361</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The targetmax is a fixed value, and it can be found here.</li>
<li>I got the difficulty from the block header information I pasted above.</li>
</ul>
<p>The targetmax is currently in hexadecimal format though, so let’s convert that to decimal.</p>
<pre><code>targetmax = 26959535291011309493156476344723991336010898738574164086137773096960</code></pre>
<p class="note tool">
I used this hexadecimal to decimal converter to do this.
</p>
<p class="note text">
I know targetmax is a hexadecimal number because it starts with 0x,
which is a prefix to signify that what comes next is hexadecimal (the 0x
 isn’t part of the number, it’s just a note). Plus the presence of
letters within the value is a dead giveaway anyway.
</p>
<p>Now we can just plug these numbers in to the equation and away we go:</p>
<pre class="math"><code>target = targetmax / difficulty
target = 26959535291011309493156476344723991336010898738574164086137773096960 / 14484.162361
target = 1861311315012765306929610463010191006516769515973403833769533170</code></pre>
<p>Ta da.</p>
<p>So when the miner was trying to solve block 100,000, she wanted to get a hash for her candidate block that would be below <code>1861311315012765306929610463010191006516769515973403833769533170</code>.</p>
<h3>Check it…</h3>
<p>Let’s compare this with the hash she got for the block to check that
she was genuinely successful (i.e.&nbsp;her hash for the block was below
 the target):</p>
<pre><code>target = 1861311315012765306929610463010191006516769515973403833769533170
hash   = 000000000003ba27aa200b1cecaad478d2b00432346c3f1f3986da1afd33e506</code></pre>
<p>Oh yeah, the hash is in hexadecimal format. Sorry. Let me convert from hexadecimal to decimal again so that we can compare the two numbers:</p>
<pre><code>target = 1861311315012765306929610463010191006516769515973403833769533170
hash   = 1533267872647776902154320487930659211795065581998445848740226310</code></pre>
<p>Yep, that hash is a smidgin smaller than the target. But it <em>is</em> lower, so the hash is successful and the block can be added to the blockchain.</p>
<div class="note text">
<p>Both the target and block hash would be stored as hexadecimal numbers
 inside the block header, so here’s what they look like if we convert
them both back to hexadecimal:</p>
<pre><code>target = 4864C00004D6AC7CD33F734B8EB28B24729FE151953EC57A21EF2
hash   = 3BA27AA200B1CECAAD478D2B00432346C3F1F3986DA1AFD33E506</code></pre>


</div>
<h2>Where can I find the current difficulty?</h2>
<p>You can find the current difficulty by entering the <code>getdifficulty</code> command in to your bitcoin client:</p>
<p class="note tip">
The difficulty can also be found with <code>getmininginfo</code> (amongst other mining info).
