<h1>27.Chain Reorganisation</h1>
<p class="subheading">Deactivating and activating blocks to adopt a new longest chain.</p>

<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/27.chain-reorganisation.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.chain-reorganisation.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>A chain reorganisation (or “reorg”) takes place when your node receives blocks that are part of a new longest chain. Your node will <em>deactivate</em> blocks in its old longest chain in favour of the blocks that build the <strong>new longest chain</strong>.</p>
<p>This process allows individual nodes across the network to <strong>agree on the same version of the blockchain</strong>, because the globally accepted view of the blockchain will always be the one with the longest chain of blocks*.</p>
<p><small class="gray">* It’s technically the chain with the most amount of <em>work</em>, but most number of blocks is usually the same thing.</small></p>

<h2>When does a chain reorganisation take place?</h2>
<p>A chain reorganisation most commonly takes place after <em>two blocks have been mined at the same time</em>.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/27.example-two-blocks.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.example-two-blocks.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>Due to the propagation speed of blocks across the network, some nodes will receive the one block first, and some nodes will receive the other block first. Therefore there will be a disagreement about which of these blocks was actually “first” and belongs at the top of everyone’s blockchain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/27.example-chain-split.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.example-chain-split.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Nodes have differing opinions on what the blockchain looks like.</p>


<p>So how can we resolve this dispute and make sure everyone agrees upon the same version of the blockchain?</p>
<p>Well, it can be resolved when the <em>next block is mined</em>. The next block to be mined will build on top of <em>one</em> of these blocks, creating a new longest chain. When nodes receive this newest block, they will see that it creates a new longest chain, and will each perform a <em>chain reorganisation</em> to adopt it.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/27.example-next-block-resolved.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.example-next-block-resolved.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Blocks in the old shorter chain are deactivated and blocks in the new longer chain are activated.</p>


<p>As a result, thanks to chain reorganisations each node has been able to independently agree on the same version of the blockchain as everyone else.</p>
<h2>What happens to the transactions in the old longest chain?</h2>
<p>Transactions inside blocks that are deactivated due to a chain reorganisation (also known as an “orphan blocks”) are no longer part of the transaction history of the blockchain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/27.orphan-block.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.orphan-block.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Only transactions in the longest chain are part of the valid history of transactions.</p>


<p>So if you tried to spend the bitcoins inside an orphan block, nodes would reject your transaction because you are trying to spend bitcoins that do not exist in the valid chain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/27.orphan-block-invalid-transaction.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.orphan-block-invalid-transaction.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>It’s as if the transaction in the orphan block never happened.</p>


<p>Practically speaking though, if two blocks are mined at the same time, they’re probably going to include the same transactions in them, so a reorg isn’t usually going to cause anyone a problem.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/27.orphan-block-similar-transactions.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.orphan-block-similar-transactions.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Your transaction is most likely included in the “competing” block after a chain reorganisation.</p>


<p>However, if there are transactions in the orphan block that are <em>not</em> in the competing block, they will get sent back in to your node’s memory pool and propagated around the network again for the <em>chance</em> to be mined in to a future block.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/27.orphan-block-transactions-recycled.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.orphan-block-transactions-recycled.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>But this is not a guarantee, and if a transaction does not exist in the active chain, it may as well have never happened.</p>
<p class="note tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> It may be worth your while to wait for a transaction to make it more than one block deep in to the blockchain before considering it as final. There is always the chance that it will get reorg’d out and you will have to wait/hope for it to be re-mined back in to the longest chain.
</p>
<h3>Orphan Block Visual Example</h3>


<p>Here we can see a reorganisation that took place in the blockchain at the block height of 578141, with some of the transactions from the orphan block being re-mined back in to the chain.</p>

<h2>FAQ.</h2>
<h3>How big can chain reorganisations be?</h3>
<p>A chain reorganisation can be any number of blocks.</p>
<p>If your node receives a new chain of blocks that’s longer than your current active chain, your node will do a chain reorganisation to adopt the new chain, no matter how long it is.</p>
<p class="note text">
This is why it’s possible for a miner with a majority of hashing power to replace blocks and transactions in your current longest chain via a 51% Attack. The longest chain always wins.
</p>
<p>However, “natural” chain reorganisations (ones that take place due to two blocks being mined at the same time) <strong>rarely involve more than the top block in your chain</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are <strong>most recent chain</strong> reorganisations my node has experienced:</p>

<h3>How often do chain reorganisations happen?</h3>
<p>Not very often. For your node to experience an honest chain reorganisation, the following needs to take place:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Two blocks are mined at the same time.</li>
<li>Your node receives one of the blocks first, but the other block ends up being mined on top of and becomes the new longest chain.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t know what the mathematical probability of this is, so here’s the frequency of chain reorganisations based on the data from my bitcoin node (which has been running continuously since <strong>17 December 2016</strong>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span data-tooltip="We received a new longest chain and updated to it, deactivating blocks in our old longest chain.">Actual Reorganisations</span>:</strong> 4 (1 every 82,734 blocks / 559.5 days)</li>
<li><strong><span data-tooltip="We heard about a chain that could become the new longest chain, but our active chain at the time continued as the longest.">Avoided Reorganisations</span>:</strong> 171 (1 every 1,935 blocks / 13.1 days)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where can you find chain reorganisations?</h3>
<p>You can see the chain reorganisations your node has observed with the <code>bitcoin-cli getchaintips</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>[
  {
    &quot;height&quot;: 589919,
    &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;000000000000000000149b18e74316248d106e42ca410f509305ae58ccda6b13&quot;,
    &quot;branchlen&quot;: 0,
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;active&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;height&quot;: 578141,
    &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;0000000000000000001253a5f37d3763dbe928d21f7d72a708f05268c044179c&quot;,
    &quot;branchlen&quot;: 1,
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;valid-fork&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;height&quot;: 575695,
    &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;0000000000000000002409ed07fdbb1d0359a0c516014115c5451aea724baec8&quot;,
    &quot;branchlen&quot;: 1,
    &quot;status&quot;: &quot;valid-headers&quot;
  },
  ...</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>brachlen</code> tells you how many blocks were in the competing chain of blocks.</li>
<li>The <code>status</code> field indicates the following:
<ul>
<li><code>active</code> - This is our current active chain (the longest chain).</li>
<li><code>valid-fork</code> - <strong>Our node performed a chain reorganisation.</strong> We downloaded and validated these blocks and had them as part of our active chain, but we later deactivated them after receiving a new longer chain of blocks.</li>
<li><code>valid-headers</code> - <strong>Our node observed a possible chain reorganisation.</strong> We downloaded these blocks, but did not validate them as our active chain was equivalent and became longer.</li>
<li><code>headers-only</code> - <strong>Our node observed a possible chain reorganisation.</strong> We received the block headers for a competing chain but did not download the full blocks.</li>
<li><code>invalid</code> - A branch that contains invalid blocks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/27.getchaintips-status.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/27.getchaintips-status.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>Therefore the branches with the status of <code>valid-fork</code> are the ones with blocks that we originally considered part of our active blockchain, but we later deactivated them after receiving a new longer chain of blocks.</p>
<p>Furthermore the branches with the status of <code>valid-headers</code> are competing chains that we received <em>after</em> already having an equivalent active chain. These could have resulted in a reorganisation, but our chain continued as the longest chain so no reorganisation took place.</p>
<p class="note tip">
It’s unlikely that you will see any chain reorganisations if you have not been running your node for a few weeks or months continuously. When your node downloads the blockchain it will only download the blocks in the longest chain (and not blocks from any branches and old chain reorganisations). Your node needs to experience the chain reorganisations as they take place for them to show up in <code>bitcoin-cli getchaintips</code>.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Chain reorganisations are a perfectly normal part of a Bitcoin node’s function. Adopting the longest known chain allows nodes across a network to agree on the same blockchain, and chain reorganisations are just a part of this process.</p>
<p>Transactions inside blocks that are deactivated due to a chain reorganisation will become invalid, but they will be recycled in to the memory pool for the opportunity to be mined in to a block on the new longest chain.</p>
