<p>No system of indicating pronunciation is self-explanatory. The
following discussion sets out the signification and use of the
pronunciation symbols in this dictionary, with special attention
to those areas where experience has shown that dictionary users
may have questions. More information can be found in the Guide to
Pronunciation in <em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</em>
and in the <a href="https://www-ccs.cs.umass.edu/mw/Mwed00000002.html#explpron">Pronunciation</a>
section of the <a href="https://www-ccs.cs.umass.edu/mw/Mwed00000002.html"><em>Explanatory Notes
for the Dictionary</em></a><em>. </em>The order of symbols
discussed below is the same as the order in the <a href="https://www-ccs.cs.umass.edu/mw/pronkey.htm">Pronunciation Key</a>, with the exception that
the symbols which are not letter characters are here listed
first. </p>

        (strongest) stress; a double mark precedes a syllable
        with secondary (medium) stress; a third level of weak
        stress requires no mark at all:
        \'pen-m&amp;n-"ship\. Since the nineteenth century
        the International Phonetics Association has recommended
        that stress marks precede the stressed syllable, and
        linguists worldwide have adopted this practice on the
        basic principle that before a syllable can be uttered the
        speaker must know what degree of stress to give it. In
        accordance with the practice of French phoneticians, no
        stress marks are shown in the transcription of words
        borrowed from French whose pronunciations have not been
        anglicized, as at <i>ancien r�gime</i> and <i>�meute. </i></td>

        <td>Hyphens are used to separate syllables in
        pronunciation transcriptions. In actual speech, of
        course, there is no pause between the syllables of a
        word. The placement of hyphens is based on phonetic
        principles, such as vowel length, nasalization, variation
        due to the position of a consonant in a syllable, and
        other nuances of the spoken word. The syllable breaks
        shown in this book reflect the careful pronunciation of a
        single word out of context. Syllabication tends to change
        in rapid or running speech: a consonant at the end of a
        syllable may shift into a following syllable, and
        unstressed vowels may be elided. The numerous variations
        in pronunciation that a word may have in running speech
        are of interest to phoneticians but are well outside the
        scope of a dictionary of general English. The bold
        periods in boldface entry words indicate potential
        end-of-line division points and not syllabication. These
        division points are determined by considerations of both
        morphology and pronunciation, among others. A detailed
        discussion of end-of-line division is contained in the
        article on Division in Boldface Entry Words in <em>Webster's
        Third New International Dictionary</em>. In this
        dictionary a consistent approach has been pursued, both
        toward word division based on traditional formulas and
        toward syllabication based on phonetic principles. As a
        result, the hyphens indicating syllable breaks and the
        centered dots indicating end-of-line division often do
        not fall in the same places. </td>

        pronunciation variant that occurs in educated speech but
        that is considered by some to be questionable or
        unacceptable. This symbol is used sparingly and primarily
        for variants that have been objected to over a period of
        time in print by commentators on usage, in schools by
        teachers, or in correspondence that has come to the
        Merriam-Webster editorial department. In most cases the
        objection is based on orthographic or etymological
        arguments. For instance, the second variant of <i>cupola </i>\'ky�-p&amp;-l&amp;,
        �-"lO\, though used frequently in speech, is
        objected to because <i>a </i>is very rarely pronounced
        \O\ in English. The pronunciations
        \'fe-by&amp;-"wer-E\ and \'fe-b&amp;-"wer-E\
        (indicated simultaneously by the use of parentheses) are
        similarly marked at the entry for <i>February </i>\�'fe-b(y)&amp;-"wer-E,
        'fe-br&amp;-\, even though they are the most frequently
        heard pronunciations, because some people insist that
        both <i>r</i>'s should be pronounced. The obelus applies
        only to that portion of the transcription which it
        immediately precedes and not to any other variants
        following. </td>

        U.S. speakers pronounce \'h&amp;r-E\ with the \&amp;r\
        representing the same sounds as in <i>bird </i>\'b&amp;rd\.
        Usually in metropolitan New York and southern England and
        frequently in New England and the southeastern U.S. the
        vowel is much the same as the vowel of <i>hum </i>followed
        by a syllable-initial variety of \r\. This pronunciation
        of <i>hurry </i>is represented as \'h&amp;-rE\ in this
        book. Both types of pronunciation are shown for words
        composed of a single meaningful unit (or <i>morpheme</i>)
        as in <i>current, hurry, </i>and <i>worry. </i>In words
        such as <i>furry, stirring, </i>and <i>purring </i>in
        which a vowel or vowel-initial suffix is added to a word
        ending in <i>r </i>or <i>rr </i>(as <i>fur, stir, </i>and
        <i>purr</i>), the second type of pronunciation outlined

        <td>as in b<b>o</b>ther, c<b>o</b>t, and, with most
        American speakers, f<b>a</b>ther, c<b>a</b>rt. The symbol
        \�\ represents the vowel of <i>cot, cod, </i>and the
        stressed vowel of <i>collar </i>in the speech of those
        who pronounce this vowel differently from the vowel in <i>caught,
        cawed, </i>and <i>caller, </i>represented by \o\. In U.S.
        speech \�\ is pronounced with little or no rounding of
        the lips, and it is fairly long in duration, especially
        before voiced consonants. In southern England \�\ is
        usually accompanied by some lip rounding and is
        relatively short in duration. The vowel \o\ generally has
        appreciable lip rounding. Some U.S. speakers (a perhaps
        growing minority) do not distinguish between <i>cot--caught,
        cod</i>--<i>cawed, </i>and <i>collar</i>--<i>caller, </i>usually
        because they lack or have less lip rounding in the words
        transcribed with \o\. Though the symbols \�\ and \o\ are
        used throughout this book to distinguish the members of
        the above pairs and similar words, the speakers who rhyme
        these pairs will automatically reproduce a sound that is
        consistent with their own speech. In words such as <i>card
        </i>and <i>cart</i> most U.S. speakers have a sequence of
        sounds that we transcribe as \�r\. Most speakers who do
        not pronounce \r\ before another consonant or a pause,
        however, do not rhyme <i>card </i>with either <i>cod</i>
        or <i>cawed </i>and do not rhyme <i>cart </i>with either <i>cot
        </i>or <i>caught. </i>The pronunciation of <i>card </i>and
        <i>cart </i>by such speakers, although not shown in this
        dictionary, would be transcribed as \'k[a']d\ and
        \'k[a']t\. Speakers of r-dropping dialects will
        automatically substitute \[a']\ for the transcribed
        \�r\. (See the sections on \[<a href="#a'">a'</a>]\ and
        \<a href="#r">r</a>\.) </td>

        <td>as in f<b>a</b>ther as pronounced by those who do not
        rhyme it with <i>bother</i>. The pronunciation of this
        vowel varies regionally. In eastern New England and
        southern England it is generally pronounced farther
        forward in the mouth than \�\ but not as far forward as
        \a\. In New York City and the southeastern U.S. it may
        have much the same quality as \�\ but somewhat greater
        duration. In areas in which \r\ is not pronounced before
        another consonant or a pause, \[a']\ occurs for the
        sequence transcribed in this book as \�r\. (See the
        sections on \<a href="#ah">�</a>\ and \<a href="#r">r</a>\.)
        In these areas \[a']\ also occurs with varying frequency
        in a small group of words in which <i>a</i> in the
        spelling is followed by a consonant letter other than <i>r
        </i>and is not preceded by <i>w </i>or <i>wh, </i>as in <i>father,
        calm, palm, </i>and <i>tomato </i>but not in <i>watch,
        what, or swap </i>(though \[a']\ does sometimes occur in <i>waft</i>).
        Especially in southern England and, less consistently, in
        eastern New England \[a']\ occurs in certain words in
        which \a\ is the usual American vowel and in most of
        which the vowel is followed by \f\, \th\, \s\, or by \n\
        and another consonant, as in the words <i>after, bath,
        mask</i>, and <i>slant</i>. The symbol \[a']\ is also
        used in the transcription of some foreign-derived words
        and names. This vowel, as in French <i>patte</i>
        "paw" and <i>chat </i>"cat," is
        intermediate between \a\ and \�\ and is similar in
        quality to the \[a']\ heard in eastern New England. </td>

        especially before a pause or voiced consonant, as in <i>shy
        </i>and <i>five, </i>the second element \i\ may not be
        pronounced. Chiefly in eastern Virginia, coastal South
        Carolina, and parts of Canada the diphthong is
        approximately \'&amp;\ + \i\ before voiceless consonants,

        Especially in positions of emphasis, such as when it is
        word final or when as primary stress, \O\ tends to become
        diphthongal, moving from \O\ toward a second element \u\.
        In southern England and in some U.S. speech, particularly
        in the Philadelphia area and in the
        Pennsylvania-Ohio-West Virginia border area, the first
        element is often approximately \&amp;\. In coastal South
        Carolina, Georgia, and Florida stressed \O\ is often
        monophthongal when final, but when a consonant follows it
        is often a diphthong moving from \O\ to \&amp;\. In this
        book the symbol \O\ represents all of the above variants.
        As an unstressed vowel before another vowel, \O\ is often
        pronounced as a schwa with slight lip rounding that is
        separated from the following vowel by the glide \w\, as
        in <i>following </i>\'f�-l&amp;-wi[ng]\. This reduced
        variant is not usually shown at individual entries. </td>

        <td>as in <b>r</b>ed, <b>r</b>a<b>r</b>ity, ca<b>r</b>,
        bea<b>r</b>d. What is transcribed here as \r\ in reality
        represents several distinct sounds. Before a stressed
        vowel \r\ denotes a continuant produced with the tongue
        tip slightly behind the teethridge. This sound is usually
        voiceless when it follows a voiceless stop, as in <i>pray,
        tree, </i>and <i>cram. </i>After a vowel in the same
        syllable \r\ is most often a semivowel characterized by
        retroflexion of the tongue tip. The sequences \ar\,
        \�r\, \er\, \ir\, \or\, \ur\, and \&amp;r\ may then be
        considered diphthongs. In some speech the retroflexion of
        the \r\ occurs throughout the articulation of the vowel,
        but in other cases the first vowel glides into a
        retroflex articulation. In the latter cases a brief
        transition vowel is sometimes heard; this variable and
        nondistinctive glide is not transcribed in this book, but
        is considered implicit in the symbol \r\. In Received
        Pronunciation \r\ is sometimes pronounced as a flap in
        the same contexts in which \t\ and \d\ occur as flaps in
        American English. (See the section on \<a href="#t">t</a>\
        below.) Occasionally the flap may be heard after
        consonants, as in <i>bright </i>and <i>grow. </i>In other
        dialects of British English, particularly Scottish, \r\
        may be pronounced as an alveolar trill or as a uvular
        trill. In some dialects, especially those of the
        southeastern U.S., eastern New England, New York City,
        and southern England, \r\ is not pronounced after a vowel
        in the same syllable. This is often, if somewhat
        misleadingly, referred to as r-dropping. In these
        dialects <i>r </i>is pronounced as a nonsyllabic \&amp;\
        when it occurs in these positions or there may be no
        sound corresponding to the <i>r,</i> thus <i>beard, corn,
        </i>and <i>assured </i>may be pronounced as \'bi&amp;d\,
        \'ko&amp;n\, and \&amp;-'shu&amp;d\ or, usually with some
        lengthening of the vowel sound, as \'bid\, \'kon\, and
        \&amp;-'shud\. In <i>car, card, </i>and <i>cart </i>those
        who do not pronounce \r\ generally have a vowel which we
        would transcribe as \A\, usually pronounced with some
        lengthening and without a following \&amp;\. (See the
        sections on \<a href="#ah">�</a>\ and \<a href="#A">A</a>\.)
        The stressed vowel of <i>bird </i>and hurt in r-dropping
        speech is similar to the vowel used by r-keepers in the
        same words but without the simultaneous raising of the
        center and/or tip of the tongue. In the U.S. most
        speakers of r-dropping dialects will pronounce \r\ before
        consonants in some words or in some contexts. Because it
        is determined by the phonetic context, r-dropping is not
        explicitly represented in this dictionary; speakers of
        r-dropping dialects will automatically substitute the
        sounds appropriate to their own speech. </td>

        unstressed vowel precedes and an unstressed vowel or
        \&amp;l\ follows, the sound represented by <i>t </i>or <i>tt
        </i>is pronounced in most American speech as a voiced
        flap produced by the tongue tip tapping the teethridge.
        In similar contexts the sound represented by <i>d </i>or <i>dd
        </i>has the same pronunciation. Thus, the pairs <i>ladder
        </i>and <i>latter, leader </i>and <i>liter, parody </i>and
        parity are often homophones. At the end of a syllable \t\
        often has an incomplete articulation with no release, or
        it is accompanied or replaced by a glottal closure. When
        \t\ occurs before the syllabic consonant \&amp;n\ as in <i>button
        </i>\'b&amp;-t&amp;n\, the glottal allophone is often
        heard. This may reflect a syllabication of \t\ with the

        Actually, this is a single sound, not two. The difference
        between \th\ and \[th]\ is that the former is pronounced
        without and the latter with vibration of the vocal cords.

        before another vowel, \�\ is often pronounced as a schwa
        with slight lip rounding that is separated from the
        following vowel by the glide \w\, as <i>valuing </i>\'val-y&amp;-wi[ng]\.
        This reduced variant is not usually shown at individual
        entries. Younger speakers of American English often use a
        more centralized and less rounded pronunciation of \�\
        in certain words (as <i>news </i>and<i> musician</i>),
        both in stressed and especially in unstressed syllables. </td>

        mouth. In English \y\ does not occur at the end of a
        syllable after a vowel. In a few words of French origin
        whose pronunciation has not been anglicized, a
        postvocalic \y\ is transcribed, as in <i>mille-feuille </i>\mEl-f[oe]y\
