<h1>01.Preface</h1>

<p>Bitcoin is an <strong>electronic payment system created in 2009</strong>. It allows you to send money to anyone in the world, and you don’t need to ask anyone’s permission to create an account.</p>

<p>It was created as a solution to the modern financial system, where we
 have a small number of large banks that control who gets an account and
 which transactions get processed. This means the control of money is <em>centralized</em>, and we have to trust the banks to act responsibly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it
electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with
barely a fraction in reserve. – Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The centralization of banking and the resulting financial crisis of
2007 inspired the development of Bitcoin. It’s a payment system, and it
runs <em>without</em> a central point of control. It was designed anonymously by Satoshi Nakamoto, and was released in January 2009.</p>
