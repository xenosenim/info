<h1>23.Mining</h1>
<p class="subheading">Adding new blocks to the blockchain.</p>

<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/23.mining.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.mining.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Mining</strong> is the process of trying to add a new block of transactions on to the blockchain. It is basically a network-wide competition where any node on the network can <em>work</em> to try and add the next block on to the chain.</p>
<p>Each newly-mined block is broadcast across the network, where each
node independently verifies it before adding it on to their blockchain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.mining-broadcast.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.mining-broadcast.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Nodes update their blockchains with the new block.</p>


<p>After adding the new block, each mining node restarts the process to try to build <em>on top</em>
 of this new block in the chain. As a result, the blockchain is
constantly being built thanks to a collaborative effort of nodes across
the network.</p>
<p class="note text">
The system designed so that a new block is mined <strong>once every 10 minutes</strong> on average.
</p>
<h2>1. How does mining work?</h2>

<p>The mining process begins by filling a candidate block with transactions from your node’s memory pool.</p>
<p>This candidate block is what we’re going to try and mine on to our
blockchain (and then send to everyone else so they can add it to their
blockchain too).</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/23.candidate-block.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.candidate-block.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>Next we construct a block header for this candidate block. This is basically a short summary of all of the data inside the block, which includes a <em>reference to an existing block</em> in the blockchain that we want to <em>build on top</em> of.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.block-header.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.block-header.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>You refer to a <em>previous block</em> by its block hash, and a summary of all the transactions in the block is contained in the merkle root.</p>


<p>Now we are ready to start “mining” this block. To do this we put this block’s <em>block header</em> through the SHA256 hash function, and hope that the number it spits out is below the current target.</p>

<p class="note caution">
<strong>Note:</strong> In mining the data gets put through the hash function <em>twice</em>, so this doesn’t give the same results (but it’s good for illustrative purposes).
</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.block-header-hash.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.block-header-hash.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The target is the number your block hash must get below to add the block on to the blockchain.</p>

<p>If the hash of your block header <em>isn’t</em> below the target, you can <em>keep trying</em> by incrementing the nonce
 field in the block header, which allows you to keep the same basic
block header but to get a completely different hash result for it. If
you’re lucky, you may end up getting a hash that’s below the current
target.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.block-header-nonce.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.block-header-nonce.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The mining
 process is basically hashing a block header as fast as you can to try
and be the first node to get a low-enough result.</p>


<p>If you manage to get a block hash below the target, you can <em>broadcast</em>
 your block to the network. Upon receiving the new block each node will
confirm that the block header hashes to below the target, then add this
“mined” block on to their blockchain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.block-broadcast.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.block-broadcast.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Congratulations, you have just mined a block of transactions on to the blockchain.</p>


<p>From here, each node will stop working on their own candidate block,
construct a new one (with fresh transactions from their memory pool),
and start trying to build on top of this new block in the chain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.block-broadcast-mining-restart.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.block-broadcast-mining-restart.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Miners start trying to add the next batch of transactions on to the chain.</p>


<p>As a result, miners are constantly working independently (yet
collaboratively) to extend the blockchain with new blocks of
transactions.</p>
<div class="note text">
<p>The process of mining is often referred to as a <strong>proof-of-work</strong>.</p>
<p>The term “proof-of-work” just refers to the fact that it takes work
to get a block hash below a target value, and once you do anyone else
can check that hashes below the target too.</p>
<p>In other words, the hash function is being used as a way to prove
that you have performed a required amount of “work” on your block.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed,
such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. – Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. Who can mine blocks?</h2>
<p><strong>Any node</strong> can try to mine a block, and each node has a
 chance of being successful. Therefore, we have a network-wide
competition where any node on the network could be the one to add the
next batch of transactions on to the blockchain.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/23.mining-competition.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.mining-competition.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>However, although anyone can try mining, being able to perform hash calculations <em>as fast as possible</em> does improve your chances of successfully mining new blocks.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/23.mining-competition-hardware.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.mining-competition-hardware.png'></a><br><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone’s chance of finding a solution at any time is proportional to their CPU power. – Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, miners with the most processing power (or “hashing
power”) are likely to mine more blocks than those who cannot hash as
quickly. So even though anyone can mine, it tends to be concentrated
amongst those with specialized mining hardware, and those with access to
 cheap electricity to power that hardware.</p>
<h2>3. Why mine blocks?</h2>
<p>Because if you are able to mine a block, you can claim a <strong>block reward</strong>.</p>
<p>You see, when you construct a candidate block, you can put your own
special transaction at the top of the block. This is called the coinbase transaction, and it allows you to send yourself a fixed amount of bitcoins that did not previously exist.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.coinbase-transaction.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.coinbase-transaction.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>The coinbase transaction effectively allows you to create new bitcoins and send them to yourself.</p>


<p>So if you end up mining this block, you would be able to spend the
bitcoins you claimed from the coinbase transaction once the block
becomes 100 blocks deep in the longest chain.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/23.block-reward-longest-chain.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.block-reward-longest-chain.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>Therefore, this <strong>block reward acts as an incentive</strong> for miners to mine new blocks and continually try to extend the longest known chain of blocks.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/23.block-reward-longest-chain-build.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.block-reward-longest-chain-build.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p class="note tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Sending bitcoins that do not already exist is only
 allowed in the coinbase transaction, which makes them the source of all
 new bitcoins.
</p>
<p class="note tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> The fact that mining introduces new bitcoins in to
 the network is why the process is called “mining”, even though from a
practical point of view it’s more about adding new transactions to the
blockchain.
</p>
<h2>4. How long does it take to mine a block?</h2>
<p>The system is designed so that one miner across the bitcoin network will successfully mine a new block <strong>once every 10 minutes</strong> on average.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/23.target-ten-minutes.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.target-ten-minutes.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>This timing is controlled by the target, which is like a limbo pole that a block’s hash has to get under for it to be allowed on to the blockchain.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.target-nodes.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.target-nodes.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Each node knows the current target for the current height of the blockchain.</p>


<p>If blocks end up being mined faster than 10 minutes on average over a
 two-week period (e.g.&nbsp;because more miners join the network), the
target will adjust downwards so that it becomes <em>more difficult</em> to mine a block, and so the average time between blocks reverts back to around 10 minutes.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.target-nodes-adjust.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.target-nodes-adjust.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Each node adjusts the target independently, but will each calculate the <em>same target</em> if they each have the <em>same chain of blocks</em>.</p>


<p>As a result, the target <em>regularly adjusts</em> to try and keep a regular interval of 10 minutes between new blocks being mined, which allows for a predictably <strong>consistent rate of new blocks</strong> and a consistent issuance of new bitcoins in to the network.</p>
<h2>5. Why do we use mining?</h2>
<p>Because this system <strong>allows computers across a network to resolve conflicts, without the need for a central computer or authority to sort them out</strong>.</p>
<p>You see, Bitcoin runs across a network of independent computers, so
it’s possible to create two conflicting transactions (sending the same
bitcoins to different places) and insert them in to different nodes on
the network at the same time. Some nodes will receive <strong>transaction A</strong> first, and other nodes will receive <strong>transaction B</strong> first.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/23.double-spend.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.double-spend.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>How can all the computers agree on which transaction should make it in to the blockchain?</p>


<p>Thanks to the mechanism of mining, <strong>only one of these transactions will make it in to the blockchain</strong>.</p>
<p>Eventually, one of the nodes on the network will mine a block of transactions from <em>their memory pool</em>, and broadcast this block to the rest of the network. When nodes receive this block, they will add it to their chain, and <strong>remove any conflicting transactions from their memory pool</strong>.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href='../images/23.double-spend-mining-resolved.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/23.double-spend-mining-resolved.png'></a><br><br></p>
<p>As a result, the process of mining acts as a sorting mechanism for
transactions across a network of computers, where mined blocks have the
final say on what belongs in the blockchain. Even better, thanks to the
fact that anyone can mine, no single node on the network is ever in
complete control of which transactions make it on to the blockchain.</p>
<p class="note caution">
Unless of course a single miner acquires a majority of the mining power…
</p>
<h2>6. How do you mine a block?</h2>
<p>You start by constructing a block header for your block. For example, here’s what the block header for block 100,000 would have started out like:</p>

<pre class="wrap blockheader"><span class="version">01000000</span><span class="previousblockhash">50120119172a610421a6c3011dd330d9df07b63616c2cc1f1cd0020000000000</span><span class="merkleroot">6657a9252aacd5c0b2940996ecff952228c3067cc38d4885efb5a4ac4247e9f3</span><span class="time">37221b4d</span><span class="bits">4c86041b</span><span class="nonce">00000000</span>
</pre>
<p>Now you’ve got the block header, you try and “mine” it by putting it
through the SHA256 hash function (twice). You keep incrementing the nonce value as you go to try and get a result below the target.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>Nonce     Hash256

<p>Eventually you may find a nonce value that produces a hash result below the target:</p>

<p class="note tip">
<strong>Tip:</strong> In the block header the nonce is a 4-byte field, where the number is in hexadecimal and in little-endian byte-order.
