<h1>09.The Blockchain</h1>
<p class="subheading">A shared file of bitcoin transactions.</p>

<h2>What is the blockchain?</h2>
<p class="note important">
The blockchain is a file that contains a list of every bitcoin transaction ever made.
</p>

<p class='clFigcaption'>The blockchain</p>


<p>Everyone on the bitcoin network shares a copy of this file, and it updates regularly with the latest transactions.</p>

<p class='clFigcaption'>The Bitcoin Network: Everyone sharing a file of transactions (called the blockchain).</p>


<h2>Why is the blockchain important?</h2>
<p class="note important">
The blockchain tells you how many bitcoins each person owns.
</p>
<p>This is because having <em>a complete list of transactions</em>
allows you to work out how many bitcoins are located at each address.
Therefore, you can figure out how many bitcoins each person has.</p>
<p>The blockchain is like a logbook, or a <em>ledger</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ledger</strong> – a book in which the monetary transactions of a business are posted in the form of debits and credits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why is it called the blockchain?</h2>
<p>Because transactions aren’t added to the file individually. Instead, they are bunched together and added in blocks. Hence, <strong>block</strong>chain.</p>
<p>Also, these blocks are <em>linked</em> together, so any changes made to a block lower down the chain will change the blocks above it. So <strong>linked</strong>blocks, or block<strong>chain</strong>.</p>

<a target='_blank' href='../images/09.03-blocks_chains.png'><img class='clImageThumb' src='../images/09.03-blocks_chains.png'></a><br><br>
<p class='clFigcaption'>Transactions are added to in blocks, and these blocks are chained together.</p>


<p>The <em>block</em>-ing of transactions makes it easier for everyone
to share a copy of the blockchain. With the Internet connection speeds
we’ve got, it’s much easier to share a file that updates once every 10
minutes, than one that updates multiple times a second.</p>
<p>The <em>chaining</em> of transactions is a security feature. It makes it difficult to tamper with the blockchain without anyone noticing.</p>
<h2>How is the blockchain shared?</h2>
<p>The blockchain is shared by the nodes on the bitcoin network, in the same way a totally legit and non-copyrighted video file might be shared on the BitTorrent network.</p>

<p class='clFigcaption'>Bitcoin
peer-to-peer file sharing of the blockchain. If my file hasn’t got the
latest blocks of transactions, someone will share them with me.</p>


<p><abbr title="Peer-to-Peer">P2P</abbr> file sharing is a topic of it’s
 own, but for now just know that the blockchain is shared like a
BitTorrent file across the bitcoin network.</p>
<h2>Where can I get a copy of the blockchain?</h2>
<p>You can get your own copy of a genuine, bona fide, electrified <del>monorail</del> <ins>blockchain</ins> by downloading the original bitcoin client.</p>
<p>Once installed and running, the client will connect to the network
and start downloading the blockchain. It’s 180+GB, so give it some time.</p>
<aside class="aside">
What? It does contain every single bitcoin transaction you know (every
one since 03 Jan 2009), so 180+GB is reasonable. Also, the initial
download of the full blockchain is a one-off thing. After that it’s
smooth sailing – your blockchain updates with the latest blocks, and
they’re only around 1MB in size.
</aside>
<p>When the download finishes you’ll have a complete copy of the
blockchain, and a list of every bitcoin transaction ever made is in your
 hands. Furthermore, every time you run the bitcoin client you will be
helping to share this file with everyone else joining the network. Some
of your friends may even start calling you a “Full Node”.</p>
<p>By keeping a copy of the blockchain and sharing it with other people on the network, you make bitcoin stronger.</p>
<p class="note text">
If you’re a fan of bittorrent, you could think of yourself as <strong>seeding</strong> the blockchain. Everyone loves a seeder.
</p>
<h3>Where is the blockchain file stored on my computer?</h3>
<p>The blockchain is stored in files with names like this: <code>blk00000.dat</code>. There’s also <code>blk00001.dat</code>, <code>blk00002.dat</code>, and so on. (It’s split in to multiple files because it’s easier than working with one huge file.)</p>
<p>Their location depends on what operating system you’re using:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Linux</dt>
<dd><code>/home/[username]/.bitcoin/blocks/</code>
</dd>
<dt>Windows</dt>
<dd><code>C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\</code>
</dd>
<dt>Mac</dt>
<dd><code>~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/</code>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, these .dat files contain data that is designed for a
computer to read, so if you open one you’ll see a lot of mumbo-jumbo.
But trust me, all the transactions are in there.</p>
<p class="note tip">
If you want to browse around a readable version of the blockchain, try my blockchain explorer. I basically take the data from the <em>blk*.dat</em> files (the very same copies you have), <em>parse</em> them, and display the contents on a web page.
