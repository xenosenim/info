<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they <i>were</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, <i>who</i> were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Now the first inhabitants that <i>dwelt</i> in their possessions in their cities <i>were</i>, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;</p>

<h3><a name='g10'></a>Chapter 10</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And when all the men of Israel that <i>were</i> in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, <i>even</i> against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking <i>counsel</i> of <i>one that had</i> a familiar spirit, to enquire <i>of it</i>;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g11'></a>Chapter 11</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <i>wast</i> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> Jebus; where the Jebusites <i>were</i>, the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <i>is</i> the city of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts <i>was</i> with him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; These also <i>are</i> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <i>and</i> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And this <i>is</i> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <i>by him</i> at one time.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <i>was one</i> of the three mighties.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; And they set themselves in the midst of <i>that</i> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved <i>them</i> by a great deliverance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; And David <i>was</i> then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison <i>was</i> then at Bethlehem.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>is</i> at the gate!</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: but David would not drink <i>of</i> it, but poured it out to the LORD,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <i>the jeopardy of</i> their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew <i>them</i>, and had a name among the three.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the <i>first</i> three.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand <i>was</i> a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the <i>first</i> three: and David set him over his guard.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Also the valiant men of the armies <i>were</i>, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,</p>

<h3><a name='g12'></a>Chapter 12</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Now these <i>are</i> they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they <i>were</i> among the mighty men, helpers of the war.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; <i>They were</i> armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in <i>hurling</i> stones and <i>shooting</i> arrows out of a bow, <i>even</i> of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; The chief <i>was</i> Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, <i>and</i> men of war <i>fit</i> for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces <i>were like</i> the faces of lions, and <i>were</i> as swift as the roes upon the mountains;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; These <i>were</i> of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least <i>was</i> over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; These <i>are</i> they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all <i>them</i> of the valleys, <i>both</i> toward the east, and toward the west.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if <i>ye be come</i> to betray me to mine enemies, seeing <i>there is</i> no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look <i>thereon</i>, and rebuke <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Then the spirit came upon Amasai, <i>who was</i> chief of the captains, <i>and he said</i>, Thine <i>are we</i>, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace <i>be</i> unto thee, and peace <i>be</i> to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; And there fell <i>some</i> of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to <i>the jeopardy of</i> our heads.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that <i>were</i> of Manasseh.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; And they helped David against the band <i>of the rovers</i>: for they <i>were</i> all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; For at <i>that</i> time day by day there came to David to help him, until <i>it was</i> a great host, like the host of God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; And these <i>are</i> the numbers of the bands <i>that were</i> ready armed to the war, <i>and</i> came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; The children of Judah that bare shield and spear <i>were</i> six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; And Jehoiada <i>was</i> the leader of the Aaronites, and with him <i>were</i> three thousand and seven hundred;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; And of the children of Issachar, <i>which were men</i> that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them <i>were</i> two hundred; and all their brethren <i>were</i> at their commandment.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: <i>they were</i> not of double heart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span>&ensp; And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span>&ensp; All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel <i>were</i> of one heart to make David king.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>39</span>&ensp; And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>40</span>&ensp; Moreover they that were nigh them, <i>even</i> unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, <i>and</i> meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for <i>there was</i> joy in Israel.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g13'></a>Chapter 13</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <i>and</i> with every leader.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <i>it seem</i> good unto you, and <i>that it be</i> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <i>that are</i> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <i>also</i> to the priests and Levites <i>which are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <i>that is</i>, to Kirjathjearim, which <i>belonged</i> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims, whose name is called <i>on it</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And David and all Israel played before God with all <i>their</i> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <i>home</i> to me?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; So David brought not the ark <i>home</i> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g14'></a>Chapter 14</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Now these <i>are</i> the names of <i>his</i> children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard <i>of it</i>, and went out against them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, <i>that</i> then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.</p>

<h3><a name='g15'></a>Chapter 15</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; And <i>David</i> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <i>both</i> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto <i>the place that</i> I have prepared for it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; For because ye <i>did it</i> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <i>to be</i> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; And with them their brethren of the second <i>degree</i>, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were appointed</i> to sound with cymbals of brass;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <i>was</i> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <i>was</i> skilful.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; And Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; And David <i>was</i> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <i>had</i> upon him an ephod of linen.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; And it came to pass, <i>as</i> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g16'></a>Chapter 16</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i>of wine</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And he appointed <i>certain</i> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Then on that day David delivered first <i>this psalm</i> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; He <i>is</i> the LORD our God; his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word <i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; <i>Even of the covenant</i> which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, <i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; And <i>when</i> they went from nation to nation, and from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; <i>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; For great <i>is</i> the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also <i>is</i> to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; For all the gods of the people <i>are</i> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Glory and honour <i>are</i> in his presence; strength and gladness <i>are</i> in his place.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Give unto the LORD the glory <i>due</i> unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let <i>men</i> say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that <i>is</i> therein.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>35</span>&ensp; And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, <i>and</i> glory in thy praise.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>36</span>&ensp; Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>37</span>&ensp; So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>38</span>&ensp; And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <i>to be</i> porters:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>39</span>&ensp; And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>40</span>&ensp; To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and <i>to do</i> according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>41</span>&ensp; And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>42</span>&ensp; And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun <i>were</i> porters.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>43</span>&ensp; And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</p>

<h3><a name='g17'></a>Chapter 17</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD <i>remaineth</i> under curtains.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for God <i>is</i> with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <i>even</i> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that <i>are</i> in the earth.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i>to be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from <i>him</i> that was before thee:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who <i>am</i> I, O LORD God, and what <i>is</i> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <i>also</i> spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; What can David <i>speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <i>these</i> great things.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; O LORD, <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <i>to be</i> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the God of Israel, <i>even</i> a God to Israel: and <i>let</i> the house of David thy servant <i>be</i> established before thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <i>in his heart</i> to pray before thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and <i>it shall be</i> blessed for ever.</p>

<h3><a name='g18'></a>Chapter 18</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot <i>horses</i>, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Then David put <i>garrisons</i> in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and <i>with him</i> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all <i>these</i> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And Joab the son of Zeruiah <i>was</i> over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, <i>were</i> the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David <i>were</i> chief about the king.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g19'></a>Chapter 19</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Then there went <i>certain</i>, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and <i>then</i> return.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And when David heard <i>of it</i>, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come <i>were</i> by themselves in the field.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put <i>them</i> in array against the Syrians.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set <i>themselves</i> in array against the children of Ammon.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do <i>that which is</i> good in his sight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; So Joab and the people that <i>were</i> with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that <i>were</i> beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>went</i> before them.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set <i>the battle</i> in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand <i>men which fought in</i> chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g20'></a>Chapter 20</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out <i>to battle</i>, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and <i>there were</i> precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And he brought out the people that <i>were</i> in it, and cut <i>them</i> with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, <i>that was</i> of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff <i>was</i> like a weaver's beam.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of <i>great</i> stature, whose fingers and toes <i>were</i> four and twenty, six <i>on each hand</i>, and six <i>on each foot</i>: and he also was the son of the giant.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g21'></a>Chapter 21</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they <i>be</i>: but, my lord the king, <i>are</i> they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all <i>they of</i> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah <i>was</i> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three <i>things</i>: choose thee one of them, that I may do <i>it</i> unto thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh <i>thee</i>; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great <i>are</i> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders <i>of Israel, who were</i> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And David said unto God, <i>Is it</i> not I <i>that</i> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but <i>as for</i> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with <i>his</i> face to the ground.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; And Ornan said unto David, Take <i>it</i> to thee, and let my lord the king do <i>that which is</i> good in his eyes: lo, I give <i>thee</i> the oxen <i>also</i> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, <i>were</i> at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p>
<p class='clNavTopPtag'><a href='#'><span class='clNavTop'></span></a></p>

<h3><a name='g22'></a>Chapter 22</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Then David said, This <i>is</i> the house of the LORD God, and this <i>is</i> the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And David commanded to gather together the strangers that <i>were</i> in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And David said, Solomon my son <i>is</i> young and tender, and the house <i>that is</i> to be builded for the LORD <i>must be</i> exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will <i>therefore</i> now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I <i>will be</i> his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Moreover <i>there are</i> workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, <i>there is</i> no number. Arise <i>therefore</i>, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, <i>saying</i>,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; <i>Is</i> not the LORD your God with you? and hath he <i>not</i> given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</p>

<h3><a name='g23'></a>Chapter 23</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Of which, twenty and four thousand <i>were</i> to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand <i>were</i> officers and judges:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Moreover four thousand <i>were</i> porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, <i>said David</i>, to praise <i>therewith</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, <i>namely</i>, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Of the Gershonites <i>were</i>, Laadan, and Shimei.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; The sons of Laadan; the chief <i>was</i> Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These <i>were</i> the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; And the sons of Shimei <i>were</i>, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four <i>were</i> the sons of Shimei.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to <i>their</i> father's house.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; Now <i>concerning</i> Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; The sons of Moses <i>were</i>, Gershom, and Eliezer.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel <i>was</i> the chief.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; And the sons of Eliezer <i>were</i>, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; These <i>were</i> the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; <i>even</i> the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; And also unto the Levites; they shall no <i>more</i> carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; For by the last words of David the Levites <i>were</i> numbered from twenty years old and above:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Because their office <i>was</i> to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for <i>that which is baked in</i> the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy <i>place</i>, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.</p>

<h3><a name='g24'></a>Chapter 24</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Now <i>these are</i> the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and <i>thus</i> were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar <i>there were</i> sixteen chief men of the house of <i>their</i> fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors <i>of the house</i> of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, <i>one</i> of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and <i>before</i> the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and <i>one</i> taken for Ithamar.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; And the rest of the sons of Levi <i>were these</i>: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first <i>was</i> Isshiah.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; Of Mahli <i>came</i> Eleazar, who had no sons.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Concerning Kish: the son of Kish <i>was</i> Jerahmeel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These <i>were</i> the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:</p>

<p><span class='dpb'>31</span>&ensp; And over the flocks <i>was</i> Jaziz the Hagerite. All these <i>were</i> the rulers of the substance which <i>was</i> king David's.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>32</span>&ensp; Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni <i>was</i> with the king's sons:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>33</span>&ensp; And Ahithophel <i>was</i> the king's counsellor: and Hushai the Archite <i>was</i> the king's companion:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>34</span>&ensp; And after Ahithophel <i>was</i> Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king's army <i>was</i> Joab.</p>

<h3><a name='g28'></a>Chapter 28</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: <i>As for me</i>, I <i>had</i> in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou <i>hast been</i> a man of war, and hast shed blood.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah <i>to be</i> the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make <i>me</i> king over all Israel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him <i>to be</i> my son, and I will be his father.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave <i>it</i> for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do <i>it</i>.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; <i>He gave</i> of gold by weight for <i>things</i> of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; <i>silver also</i> for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, <i>both</i> for the candlestick, and <i>also</i> for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; And by weight <i>he gave</i> gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and <i>likewise</i> silver for the tables of silver:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons <i>he gave gold</i> by weight for every bason; and <i>likewise silver</i> by weight for every bason of silver:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out <i>their wings</i>, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; All <i>this, said David</i>, the LORD made me understand in writing by <i>his</i> hand upon me, <i>even</i> all the works of this pattern.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do <i>it</i>: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, <i>even</i> my God, <i>will be</i> with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, <i>even they shall be with thee</i> for all the service of the house of God: and <i>there shall be</i> with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people <i>will be</i> wholly at thy commandment.</p>

<h3><a name='g29'></a>Chapter 29</h3>
<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, <i>is yet</i> young and tender, and the work <i>is</i> great: for the palace <i>is</i> not for man, but for the LORD God.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for <i>things to be made</i> of gold, and the silver for <i>things</i> of silver, and the brass for <i>things</i> of brass, the iron for <i>things</i> of iron, and wood for <i>things</i> of wood; onyx stones, and <i>stones</i> to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, <i>which</i> I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; <i>Even</i> three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses <i>withal</i>:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; The gold for <i>things</i> of gold, and the silver for <i>things</i> of silver, and for all manner of work <i>to be made</i> by the hands of artificers. And who <i>then</i> is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; And they with whom <i>precious</i> stones were found gave <i>them</i> to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed <i>be</i> thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Thine, O LORD, <i>is</i> the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all <i>that is</i> in the heaven and in the earth <i>is thine</i>; thine <i>is</i> the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Both riches and honour <i>come</i> of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand <i>is</i> power and might; and in thine hand <i>it is</i> to make great, and to give strength unto all.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; But who <i>am</i> I, and what <i>is</i> my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things <i>come</i> of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; For we <i>are</i> strangers before thee, and sojourners, as <i>were</i> all our fathers: our days on the earth <i>are</i> as a shadow, and <i>there is</i> none abiding.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name <i>cometh</i> of thine hand, and <i>is</i> all thine own.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all <i>these things</i>, and to build the palace, <i>for</i> the which I have made provision.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, <i>even</i> a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, <i>and</i> a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed <i>him</i> unto the LORD <i>to be</i> the chief governor, and Zadok <i>to be</i> priest.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him <i>such</i> royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>26</span>&ensp; Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>27</span>&ensp; And the time that he reigned over Israel <i>was</i> forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three <i>years</i> reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>28</span>&ensp; And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>29</span>&ensp; Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>30</span>&ensp; With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
