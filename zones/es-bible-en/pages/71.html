<h2>The New Testament</h2>

<h1>The Epistle of Paul to Philemon</h1>

<p><span class='dpb'>1</span>&ensp; Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy <i>our</i> brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>2</span>&ensp; And to <i>our</i> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>3</span>&ensp; Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>4</span>&ensp; I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>5</span>&ensp; Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>6</span>&ensp; That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>7</span>&ensp; For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>8</span>&ensp; Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>9</span>&ensp; Yet for love's sake I rather beseech <i>thee</i>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>10</span>&ensp; I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>11</span>&ensp; Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>12</span>&ensp; Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>13</span>&ensp; Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>14</span>&ensp; But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>15</span>&ensp; For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>16</span>&ensp; Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>17</span>&ensp; If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>18</span>&ensp; If he hath wronged thee, or oweth <i>thee</i> ought, put that on mine account;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>19</span>&ensp; I Paul have written <i>it</i> with mine own hand, I will repay <i>it</i>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>20</span>&ensp; Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>21</span>&ensp; Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>22</span>&ensp; But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>23</span>&ensp; There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>24</span>&ensp; Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>
<p><span class='dpb'>25</span>&ensp; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit. Amen.</p>
<p class='ps'>Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.</p>
